This folder contains the edited XML files of every Greek and English work by Philo Judaeus that exists on Scaife viewer
It also contains the notebook 1st1K_XML_fileprocessing_.ipynb which shows how I edited the XML files (specifically the xml:base attribute) and 
updated them according to the CTS URN guidelines of the First1KGreek project.
