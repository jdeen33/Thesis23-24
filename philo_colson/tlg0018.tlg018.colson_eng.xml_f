About Those Whose Names are Changed and Why They Have Their Names Changed
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“Abraham became ninety-nine years old and the</s><s id="section1sent2">Lord was seen by Abraham and said to him, ‘I am thy God’” (Gen. xvii. 1). Nine plus ninety is next neighbour to a hundred, the number irradiated by the self-taught nature Isaac who is joy, the best of the good emotions.</s><s id="section1sent3">For Isaac is born to Abraham when a hundred years old.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">A hundred also represents</s><s id="section2sent2">the first-fruits given to the priests by the Tribe of Levi.</s><s id="section2sent3">For when the Levites receive the tenths they offer from them, just as though they were their own produce, other tenths in which we find the hundred (Num. xviii. 26).</s><s id="section2sent4">For ten is a symbol of progress and a hundred of perfection.</s><s id="section2sent5">Now he who is in the intermediate stage is always pressing forward to the summit, employing the gifts with which nature has blessed him, and it is by such a one that Moses tells us that the Lord of all was seen.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">Yet</s><s id="section3sent2">do not suppose that the vision was presented to the eyes of the body.</s><s id="section3sent3">They see only the objects of sense and those are composite, brimful of corruptibility, while the divine is uncompounded and incorruptible.</s><s id="section3sent4">It is the eye of the soul which receives the presentation of the divine vision.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Moreover what the eyes</s><s id="section4sent2">of the body behold they apprehend through the cooperation of light, and light is something different from either the seer or the thing seen, whereas what the soul beholds it beholds by its own agency without the assistance of any other.</s><s id="section4sent3">For the conceptions of the mind are a light to themselves.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Our learning</s><s id="section5sent2">of the sciences follows the same rule.</s><s id="section5sent3">The mind applies its eye which never closes or sleeps to the principles and conclusions set before it and sees them by no borrowed but a genuine light which shines forth from itself.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">And so when you hear that God</s><s id="section6sent2">was seen by man, you must think that this takes place without the light which the senses know, for what belongs to mind can be apprehended only by the mental powers.</s><s id="section6sent3">And God is the fountain of the purest radiance, and so when He reveals Himself to a soul the rays</s><s id="section6sent4">He puts forth are free from all shadow and of intense brightness.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">Do not however suppose that the Existent</s><s id="section7sent2">which truly exists is apprehended by any man; for we have in us no organ by which we can envisage it, neither in sense, for it is not perceptible by sense, nor yet in mind.</s><s id="section7sent3">So Moses the explorer of nature which lies beyond our vision, Moses who, as the divine oracles tell us, entered into the darkness</s><s id="section7sent4">(Ex. xx. 21), by which figure they indicate existence invisible and incorporeal, searched everywhere and into everything in his desire to see clearly and plainly Him, the object of our much yearning, Who alone is good.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">And when there was no sign of finding aught, not</s><s id="section8sent2">even any semblance of what he hoped for, in despair of learning from others, he took refuge with the Object of his search Itself and prayed in these words: “Reveal Thyself to me that I may see Thee with knowledge” (Ex. xxxiii. 13).</s><s id="section8sent3">And yet he fails to gain his object.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">To know what lies below the Existent, things material and immaterial alike, is a most ample gift even for the best sort among mortals, as God judges, for we read, “Thou shalt see what is behind</s><s id="section9sent2">Me, but My face thou shalt not see” (ibid. 23).</s><s id="section9sent3">It means that all below the Existent, things material and immaterial alike, are available to apprehension even if they are not all actually apprehended as yet, but He alone by His very nature cannot be seen.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">And why should we wonder that the Existent cannot</s><s id="section10sent2">be apprehended by men when even the mind in each of us is unknown to us?</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">For who knows the essential nature of the soul, that mystery which has bred numberless contentions among the sophists who propound opinions contrary to each other or even totally and generically opposed?</s><s id="section11sent2">It is a logical</s><s id="section11sent3">consequence that no personal name even can be properly assigned to the truly Existent.</s><s id="section11sent4">Note that when the prophet desires to know what he must answer to those who ask about His name</s><s id="section11sent5">He says “I am He that is” (Ex iii. 14), which is equivalent to “My nature is to be, not to be spoken.”</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Yet that</s><s id="section12sent2">the human race should not totally lack a title to give to the supreme goodness</s><s id="section12sent3">He allows them to use by licence of language, as though it were His proper</s><s id="section12sent4">name,</s><s id="section12sent5">the title of Lord God of the three natural orders, teaching, perfection, practice,</s><s id="section12sent6">which are symbolized in the records as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</s><s id="section12sent7">For this</s><s id="section12sent8">He says is “My age-long name,” belonging as it were to the age of human existence, not to that when age as yet was not, “a memorial” too, not set, that is, beyond memory or apprehension, and again “to generations” (ibid. 15), not to beings that were never generated.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">For those who are born into</s><s id="section13sent2">mortality must needs have some substitute for the divine name, so that they may approach if not the fact at least the name of supreme excellence and be brought into relation with it.</s><s id="section13sent3">And this is shown by the oracle proclaimed as from the mouth of the Ruler of all in which</s><s id="section13sent4">He says that no proper name of Him has been revealed to any.</s><s id="section13sent5">“I was seen,” He says, “of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, being their God, and My name of ‘Lord’ I did not reveal to them” (Ex. vi. 3).</s><s id="section13sent6">For when the transposition</s><s id="section13sent7">is reset in the proper order it will run thus, “My proper name I did not reveal to thee,” but, He implies, only the substitute, and that for reasons already mentioned.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">So</s><s id="section14sent2">impossible to name indeed is the Existent that not even the Potencies who serve Him tell us a proper name.</s><s id="section14sent3">Thus after the wrestling-bout in which the Man</s><s id="section14sent4">of Practice engaged in his quest of virtue, he says to the unseen master,</s><s id="section14sent5">“Announce to me Thy name,” and he said “Why dost thou ask this my name?” (Gen. xxxii. 29), and he refuses to tell his personal and proper name.</s><s id="section14sent6">“It is enough for thee,” he means, “to profit through my benediction, but as for names, those symbols which indicate created beings, look not for them in the case of imperishable natures.”</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">Think it not then a hard saying that the Highest</s><s id="section15sent2">of all things should be unnamable when His Word has no name of its own which we can speak.</s><s id="section15sent3">And indeed if He is unnamable He is also inconceivable and incomprehensible.</s><s id="section15sent4">And so the words “The Lord was seen of Abraham” (Gen. xvii.</s><s id="section15sent5">1) must not be understood in the sense that the Cause of all shone upon him and appeared to him, for what human mind could contain the vastness of that vision?</s><s id="section15sent6">Rather we must think of it as the manifestation of one of the Potencies which attend him, the Potency of kingship, for the title Lord betokens sovereignty and kingship.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">While our mind pursued</s><s id="section16sent2">the airy speculations of the Chaldeans it ascribed to the world powers of action which it regarded as causes.</s><s id="section16sent3">But when it migrated from the Chaldean creed it recognized that the world had for its charioteer and pilot a Ruler Whose sovereignty was presented to it in vision.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">And therefore the words are “The</s><s id="section17sent2">Lord (not “The Existent”) was seen of him,” as though it would say, The king has been manifested, king indeed from the first, but hitherto unrecognized</s><s id="section17sent3">by the soul, which so long unschooled has not remained in ignorance for ever but has received the vision of the Sovereignty which rules over all that is.</s><s id="section17sent4">But the Sovereign when manifested</s><s id="section17sent5">confers a still higher gift on him who sees and hears him.</s><s id="section17sent6">He says to him, “I am thy God.”</s><s id="section17sent7">Which indeed amongst all this multitude of created things does not have Thee for its god?</s><s id="section17sent8">I might ask.</s><s id="section17sent9">But</s><s id="section17sent10">His interpreting word will shew me that He does not here speak of the world of which doubtless</s><s id="section17sent11">He is Creator and God, but of human souls which do not in His eyes deserve to be cared for all alike.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">His will</s><s id="section18sent2">is to be called the Lord and Master of the bad, the God of those who are on the way to betterment, but of the best and most perfect both at once God and Lord.</s><s id="section18sent3">For instance, when He has set Pharaoh before us as the crowning example of impiety</s><s id="section18sent4">He never calls Himself his God but gives that name to wise Moses, “Behold I give thee as god to Pharaoh” (Ex. vii. 1). But</s><s id="section18sent5">He often names Himself as Lord in the oracles which He gives.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">We find such utterances as these, “These things saith the Lord”</s><s id="section19sent2">(Ex. vii. 17), and at the beginning of His speech</s><s id="section19sent3">“The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ‘I am the Lord, speak unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I speak unto thee’” (Ex. vi.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">29).</s><s id="section20sent2">And Moses says to Pharaoh, “When I go forth from the city I</s><s id="section20sent3">will spread out my hands to the Lord, and the sounds shall cease and the hail and the rain shall not be, that thou mayest know that to the Lord belongs the earth” (that is all the bodily earth-compounded frame), “and thou” (that is the mind which the body</s><s id="section20sent4">carries with it) “and thy servants” (that is the several thoughts which form its guard), “for I know that ye have not yet feared the Lord” (Ex. ix. 29), meaning that Lord who is not merely so-called but is Lord in very truth.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">For none that is created is</s><s id="section21sent2">truly a lord, though he be invested with a rule that spreads from pole to pole.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">Only the Uncreated is truly ruler, and he who lives in fear and awe under that Ruler’s government receives a prize of truest value in His reproofs, while he who despises them has before him nothing but to perish miserably.</s><s id="section22sent2">So then He is shown to be the Lord of the foolish in</s><s id="section22sent3">that He holds over them the terrors that are proper to the sovereign.</s><s id="section22sent4">Of those who are on the way to betterment</s><s id="section22sent5">He is called in scripture God, as in this present passage, “I am thy God,” or “I am thy God, increase and multiply” (Gen. xxxv. 11).</s><s id="section22sent6">Of the perfect He is both Lord and God as in the Decalogue “I am thy Lord God” (Ex. xx. 2), and elsewhere “The Lord God of your fathers” (Deut. iv.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">1), for it is His will that the wicked man should</s><s id="section23sent2">be under His sway as his Lord, and thus with awe and groaning feel the fear of the Master hanging over him; that the man of progress should be benefited by Him as God and thus through those kindnesses reach perfection; that the perfect should be guided by Him as Lord and benefited by Him as God.</s><s id="section23sent3">For through the one he remains free from lapses, through the other he is most surely God’s man.</s><s id="section23sent4">This is best shown in Moses’ case.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">“This is the</s><s id="section24sent2">blessing,” we read, “which Moses gave, the man of God” (Deut. xxxiii. 1).</s><s id="section24sent3">To what a glorious, what a</s><s id="section24sent4">holy exchange is he promoted that in return for God’s protecting care he should give himself to God.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">But do not suppose that God becomes man’s in the</s><s id="section25sent2">same way that man becomes God’s, for a man is God’s as His possession, God is man’s to be his glory and assistance.</s><s id="section25sent3">If thou wouldst have God as thy heart’s portion, first become thyself a portion worthy for Him to take, and that thou shalt become if thou escape such faults as are thine own handiwork and come of free will.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">We should remember this also that the words</s><s id="section26sent2">“I am thy God” are used by licence of language and not in their proper sense, for the Existent considered as existent is not relative.</s><s id="section26sent3">He is full of Himself and is sufficient for Himself.</s><s id="section26sent4">It was so before the creation of the world, and is equally so after the creation of all that is.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">He cannot change nor alter</s><s id="section27sent2">and needs nothing else at all, so that all things are His but He Himself in the proper sense belongs to none.</s><s id="section27sent3">But the Potencies which</s><s id="section27sent4">He has projected into creation to benefit what He has framed are in some cases spoken of as in a sense relative,</s><s id="section27sent5">such as</s><s id="section27sent6">the kingly and the beneficial, for a king is a king of someone and a benefactor the benefactor of someone, while the subject of the kingship and the recipient of the benefit is necessarily something different.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">Akin to these two is the creative Potency</s><s id="section28sent2">called God, because through this the Father who is its begetter and contriver made</s><s id="section28sent3">the universe, so that “I am thy God” is equivalent to “I am the Maker and Artificer.”</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">And the greatest gift we can have</s><s id="section29sent2">is to have Him for our Architect, Who was also the Architect of the whole world, for He did not form the soul of the bad, since wickedness is at enmity with Him, and in framing the soul which is in the intermediate stage</s><s id="section29sent3">He was not the sole agent according to the holiest of men, Moses, since such a soul would surely admit like wax the different qualities of noble and base.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">And therefore we read,</s><s id="section30sent2">“Let us make man after our image” (Gen. i. 26), so that according as the wax received the bad or the noble impress it should appear to be the handiwork of others or of Him Who is the framer of the noble and the good alone.</s><s id="section30sent3">Surely then he is a man of virtue to whom God says “I am thy God,” for he has God alone for his maker without the co-operation of others.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">At the same time</s><s id="section31sent2">Moses teaches us here</s><s id="section31sent3">by implication the doctrine which he so often</s><s id="section31sent4">lays down that God is the maker of the wise and good only.</s><s id="section31sent5">And all that company</s><s id="section31sent6">have voluntarily stripped themselves of the external goods which are so abundantly supplied to us, and further have despised what is dear to the flesh.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">Fine, lusty and athletic</s><s id="section32sent2">are those who use the body as a menace to the soul.</s><s id="section32sent3">Pale, wasted and withered, so to speak, are the children of discipline.</s><s id="section32sent4">They have made over the bodily muscles to serve the powers of the soul and in fact are resolved into a single form, that of soul, and become unbodied minds.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Naturally then the earthly</s><s id="section33sent2">element is destroyed and dissolved when the mind in all its powers has a fixed purpose to be well pleasing to God.</s><s id="section33sent3">But that kind is rare and hardly to be found, though that such should be is not impossible.</s><s id="section33sent4">This is shown by the oracle vouchsafed about Enoch.</s><s id="section33sent5">“Enoch was well pleasing to God and was not found”</s><s id="section33sent6">(Gen. v.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">24), for where</s><s id="section34sent2">could one search and find this good thing, what seas should he cross, what islands, what continents should he visit?</s><s id="section34sent3">Shall he look for it among the Greeks or the barbarians?</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">Indeed are there not still among</s><s id="section35sent2">the disciples of philosophy some who say that a wise man is non-existent</s><s id="section35sent3">and therefore wisdom also?</s><s id="section35sent4">None, they say, from the beginning of man’s creation up to the life of to-day has been held to be completely free from fault, for absolute happiness is impossible to one who is imprisoned in the mortal body.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Whether</s><s id="section36sent2">these statements are true we will inquire at the proper occasion.</s><s id="section36sent3">At present we will accept the text and say that wisdom is indeed something which exists, and so too is the lover of wisdom, the sage, but, though he exists, we who are evil fail to see him, for good cannot keep company with bad.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">Therefore</s><s id="section37sent2">we are told that “he was not found,” this type of character which was well pleasing to God, meaning</s><s id="section37sent3">doubtless that though actually existing he was hidden from us and shunned our company.</s><s id="section37sent4">And to confirm this we read that he was “translated”</s><s id="section37sent5">(ibid.), that is, changed his abode and journeyed as an emigrant from the mortal life to the immortal.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">These are men inspired with heaven-sent madness,</s><s id="section38sent2">men who have gone out into the wild.</s><s id="section38sent3">But there are others who have followed a tame and gentle wisdom,</s><s id="section38sent4">and such are both eminent in the practice of piety and do not despise human things.</s><s id="section38sent5">This is attested by the oracle in which it is said to Abraham, with God as speaker, “Be well pleasing before Me” (Gen. xvii.</s><s id="section38sent6">1), that is, “be well pleasing not to Me only but to My works, while I as judge watch and survey thee.”</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">For if you honour parents or show</s><s id="section39sent2">mercy to the poor or do kindness to your friends or defend your country or observe with care your duties to all men in general, you will surely be well pleasing to all with whom you have to do, but also well pleasing before God.</s><s id="section39sent3">For</s><s id="section39sent4">He with an eye that never sleeps beholds all things, and what is good He summons to Himself and approves with special favour.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">And therefore the Practiser in his prayer will show</s><s id="section40sent2">us the same truth.</s><s id="section40sent3">“The God,” he says, “to whom my fathers were well pleasing,” and adds “before Him” (Gen. xlviii. 15) to show us the difference in fact between being pleasing “to Him” and “before Him.”</s><s id="section40sent4">The latter embraces both kinds of well pleasing, the former is confined to one only.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">And</s><s id="section41sent2">so Moses in his Exhortations</s><s id="section41sent3">charges them in these words: “Thou shalt do what is well pleasing before the Lord thy God” (Deut. xii. 28), meaning do such things as shall be worthy to appear before God, and when seen to be approved by Him, and such</s><s id="section41sent4">deeds as these commonly extend to our fellow-men.</s></p></div>
