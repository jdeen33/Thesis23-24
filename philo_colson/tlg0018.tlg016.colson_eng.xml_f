On Mating With the Preliminary Studies
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“Now Sarah the wife of Abraham was not bearing</s><s id="section1sent2">him children, but she had an Egyptian handmaiden named Hagar, and Sarah said to Abraham, ‘Behold the Lord hath closed me that I should not bear.</s><s id="section1sent3">Go in unto my handmaid and beget children from her’” (Gen. xvi.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">1, 2). Now Sarah’s name is, by interpretation,</s><s id="section2sent2">“sovereignty of me,” and the wisdom in me, the self-control in me, the individual righteousness and each of the other virtues whose place is confined to the “me,” are a sovereignty over me only.</s><s id="section2sent3">That sovereignty rules and dominates me, who have willed to render obedience to it, in virtue of its natural queenship.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">| This ruling power Moses</s><s id="section3sent2">represents as at once barren and exceedingly prolific, since he acknowledges that from her sprang the most populous of nations.</s><s id="section3sent3">A startling paradox, yet true.</s><s id="section3sent4">For indeed virtue is barren as regards all that is bad, but shews herself a fruitful mother of the good; a motherhood which needs no midwifery, for she bears before the midwife comes.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Animals and plants bear</s><s id="section4sent2">the fruit proper to them only after considerable intervals, once or twice at most in the year, the number being determined for each by nature and adjusted</s><s id="section4sent3">to the seasons of the year.</s><s id="section4sent4">But virtue has no such intervals.</s><s id="section4sent5">She bears ceaselessly, successively, from moment to moment, and her offspring are no infants, but honest words, innocent purposes and laudable acts.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">But as wealth which one cannot use</s><s id="section5sent2">does not profit the owner, so the motherhood of virtue profits not if the offspring be not profitable for ourselves.</s><s id="section5sent3">Some she judges quite worthy to share her life, but others she thinks have not yet reached the age to submit to her admirable and chaste and sober domesticity.</s><s id="section5sent4">Such she allows to celebrate the preliminaries of marriage, and holds out hopes of consummating the full rite in the future.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">So Sarah, the</s><s id="section6sent2">virtue which rules my soul, was a mother, but not a mother for me.</s><s id="section6sent3">For young as I was I could not yet receive her offspring, wisdom, justice, piety, because of the multitude of bastard children whom vain imaginations had borne to me.</s><s id="section6sent4">The nurture of these, the constant supervision, the ceaseless anxiety, compelled me to take little thought of the genuine, the truly free-born.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">It is well then to pray that virtue</s><s id="section7sent2">may not only bear (she does that in abundance without our prayers), but also may bear for ourselves, that we, by sharing in what she sows and genders, may enjoy happiness.</s><s id="section7sent3">For in ordinary course she bears for God only, thankfully rendering the first-fruits of the blessings bestowed upon her to Him who, as Moses says, opens the womb which yet loses not its virginity (Gen. xxix.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">31).</s><s id="section8sent2">In confirmation of</s><s id="section8sent3">this we read that the candlestick, that is the original pattern of the later copy,</s><s id="section8sent4">gives light from one part</s><s id="section8sent5">only, that is the part where it looks towards God.</s><s id="section8sent6">For being seventh in position, and placed between the six branches, divided as they are into triplets which guard it on either side, it sends its rays upwards towards the Existent, as though feeling that its light were too bright for human sight to look upon it (Ex. xxv. 37, 31).</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">This is why Moses</s><s id="section9sent2">does not say that Sarah did not bear, but only that she did not bear for some particular person.</s><s id="section9sent3">For we are not capable as yet of receiving the impregnation of virtue unless we have first mated with her handmaiden, and the handmaiden of wisdom is the culture gained by the primary learning of the school course.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">For, just as in houses we have outer doors in front of</s><s id="section10sent2">the chamber doors, and in cities suburbs through which we can pass to the inner part, so the school course precedes virtue; the one is a road which leads to the other.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Now we must understand that great themes need</s><s id="section11sent2">great introductions; and the greatest of all themes is virtue, for it deals with the greatest of materials, that is the whole life of man.</s><s id="section11sent3">Naturally, then, virtue will employ no minor kind of introduction, but grammar, geometry, astronomy, rhetoric, music, and all the other branches of intellectual study.</s><s id="section11sent4">These are symbolized by Hagar, the handmaid of Sarah, as I shall proceed to shew.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">For Sarah, we are told, said</s><s id="section12sent2">to Abraham: “Behold, the Lord has shut me out from bearing.</s><s id="section12sent3">Go in unto my handmaid, that thou mayest beget children from her.”</s><s id="section12sent4">In the present discussion, we must eliminate all bodily unions or</s><s id="section12sent5">intercourse which has pleasure as its object.</s><s id="section12sent6">What is meant is a mating of mind with virtue.</s><s id="section12sent7">Mind desires to have children by virtue, and, if it cannot do so at once, is instructed to espouse virtue’s handmaid, the lower instruction.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Now we may</s><s id="section13sent2">well feel profound admiration for the discretion</s><s id="section13sent3">shewn by Wisdom.</s><s id="section13sent4">She refrains from reproaching us with our backwardness or complete impotence in generation, though, as the text truly stated, it was through our unfitness that she was not bearing, and not because she grudged us offspring.</s><s id="section13sent5">Thus she says,
“The Lord has shut me out from bearing,” and does not go on to add, “for you.”</s><s id="section13sent6">She does not wish to seem to upbraid and reproach others for their misfortune.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">| “Go in, then,” she says, “to</s><s id="section14sent2">my handmaid, the lower instruction given by the lower branches of school lore, that first you may have children by her,” for afterwards you will be able to avail yourself of the mistress’s company to beget children of higher birth.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">| For grammar</s><s id="section15sent2">teaches us to study literature in the poets and historians, and will thus produce intelligence and wealth of knowledge.</s><s id="section15sent3">It will teach us also to despise the vain delusions of our empty imagination by shewing us the calamities which heroes and demi-gods who are celebrated in such literature are said to have undergone.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">Music will charm away the</s><s id="section16sent2">unrhythmic by its rhythm, the inharmonious by its harmony, the unmelodious and tuneless by its melody,</s><s id="section16sent3">and thus reduce discord to concord.</s><s id="section16sent4">Geometry will sow in the soul that loves to learn the seeds of equality</s><s id="section16sent5">and proportion, and by the charm of its logical continuity will raise from those seeds a zeal for justice.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">Rhetoric, sharpening the mind to the observation</s><s id="section17sent2">of facts, and training and welding thought to expression,</s><s id="section17sent3">will make the man a true master of words and thoughts, thus taking into its charge the peculiar and special gift which nature has not bestowed on any other living creature.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Dialectic,</s><s id="section18sent2">the sister and twin,</s><s id="section18sent3">as some have said, of Rhetoric, distinguishes true argument from false, and convicts the plausibilities of sophistry, and thus will heal that great plague of the soul, deceit.</s><s id="section18sent4">It is
profitable then to take these and the like for our associates and for the field of our preliminary studies.</s><s id="section18sent5">For perhaps indeed it may be with us, as it has been with many, that through the vassals we shall come to the knowledge of the royal virtues.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Observe too that</s><s id="section19sent2">our body is not nourished in the earlier stages with solid and costly foods.</s><s id="section19sent3">The simple and milky foods of infancy come first.</s><s id="section19sent4">Just so you may consider that the school subjects and the lore which belongs to each of them stand ready to nourish the childhood of the soul, while the virtues are grown-up food, suited for those who are really men.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">The primary characteristic marks of the lower</s><s id="section20sent2">education are represented by two symbols giving its race and its name.</s><s id="section20sent3">In race it is Egypt, but its name is Hagar, which is by interpretation “sojourning.”</s><s id="section20sent4">The votary of the school studies, the friend of wide learning, must necessarily be associated with the earthly and Egyptian body; since he needs eyes</s><s id="section20sent5">to see and read, ears to listen and hear, and the other senses to unveil the several objects of sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">For the</s><s id="section21sent2">thing judged cannot be apprehended without one to judge it, and it is sense which judges the sensible, and therefore without sense it is always impossible to obtain accurate knowledge of any of the phenomena in the sensible world which form the staple of philosophy.</s><s id="section21sent3">Sense being the bodily part of the soul is riveted to the vessel of the soul as a whole, and this soul-vessel is symbolically called Egypt.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">This, then, is one of the marks of the handmaid of</s><s id="section22sent2">virtue, namely that of race.</s><s id="section22sent3">Let us now consider the nature of the other mark, that of name.</s><s id="section22sent4">The lower education is in the position of a sojourner.</s><s id="section22sent5">For knowledge and wisdom and every virtue are native born, indigenous, citizens in the truest sense, and in this they are absolutely alone; but the other kinds of training, which win second or third or last prizes, are on the border-line between foreigners and citizens.</s><s id="section22sent6">For they belong to neither kind in its pure form, and yet in virtue of a certain degree of partnership they touch both.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">The sojourner in so far as he is staying in the</s><s id="section23sent2">city is on a par with the citizens, in so far as it is not his home, on a par with foreigners.</s><s id="section23sent3">In the same way, I should say, adopted children, in so far as they inherit from their adopters, rank with the family; in so far as they are not their actual children, with outsiders.</s><s id="section23sent4">Sarah, virtue, bears, we shall find, the same relation to Hagar, education, as the mistress to the servant-maid, or the lawful wife to the concubine, and so naturally the mind which aspires to study and to gain knowledge, the mind we call Abraham, will have Sarah, virtue, for his wife, and Hagar, the whole range of school culture, for his concubine.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">He then who gains wisdom by instruction will not</s><s id="section24sent2">reject Hagar, for the acquisition of these preliminary subjects is quite necessary,</s><s id="section24sent3">() but, anyone whose mind is set on enduring to the end the weary contest in which virtue is the prize, who practises continually for that end, and is unflagging in self-discipline, will take to him two lawful wives and as handmaids to them two concubines.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">And to each of them is given a different</s><s id="section25sent2">nature and appearance.</s><s id="section25sent3">Thus one of the lawful wives is a movement, sound, healthy and peaceful, and to express her history Moses names her Leah or
“smooth.”</s><s id="section25sent4">The other is like a whetstone.</s><s id="section25sent5">Her name is Rachel, and on that whetstone the mind which loves effort and exercise sharpens its edge.</s><s id="section25sent6">Her name means “vision of profanation,” not because her way of seeing is profane, but on the contrary, because she judges the visible world of sense to be not holy but profane, compared with the pure and undefiled nature of the invisible world of mind.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">For</s><s id="section26sent2">since our soul is twofold, with one part reasoning and the other unreasoning, each has its own virtue or excellence, the reasoning Leah, the unreasoning Rachel.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">|</s><s id="section27sent2">The virtue we call Rachel, acting</s><s id="section27sent3">through the senses and the other parts of our unreasoning nature, trains us to despise all that should be held of little account, reputation and wealth and</s><s id="section27sent4">pleasure, which the vulgar mass of ordinary men who accept the verdict of dishonest hearsay and the equally dishonest court of the other senses, judge worthy of their admiration and their efforts.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">Leah</s><s id="section28sent2">teaches us to avoid the rough and uneven path, impassable to virtue-loving souls, and to walk smoothly along the level highway where there are no stumbling-blocks or aught that can make the foot to slip.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">| Necessarily then Leah will have for her</s><s id="section29sent2">handmaid the faculty of expression by means of the vocal organs, and on the side of thought the art of devising clever arguments whose easy persuasiveness is a means of deception,</s><s id="section29sent3">while Rachel has for her’s the necessary means of sustenance, eating and drinking.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Moses has given us, as the names of these</s><s id="section30sent2">two handmaidens, Zilpah and Bilhah (Gen. xxx. 3, 9).</s><s id="section30sent3">Zilpah by interpretation is “a walking mouth,”</s><s id="section30sent4">which signifies the power of expressing thought in language and directing the course of an exposition, while Bilhah is “swallowing,” the first and most necessary support of mortal animals.</s><s id="section30sent5">For our bodies are anchored on swallowing, and the cables of life are fastened on to it as their base.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">| With all</s><s id="section31sent2">these aforesaid faculties the Man of Practice mates, with one pair as free-born legitimate wives, with the other pair as slaves and concubines.</s><s id="section31sent3">For he desires the smooth, the Leah movement, which will produce health in the body, noble living and justice in the soul.</s><s id="section31sent4">He loves Rachel when he wrestles with the passions and when he goes into training to gain self-control,</s><s id="section31sent5">and takes his stand to oppose all the objects of sense.</s><s id="section31sent6">For help may take two forms.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">It may act by giving</s><s id="section32sent2">us enjoyment of the good, the way of peace, or by opposing and removing ill, the way of war.</s><s id="section32sent3">So it is Leah through whom it comes to pass that he reaps the higher and dominant blessings, Rachel through whom he wins what we may call the spoils of war.</s><s id="section32sent4">Such is his life with the legitimate wives.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">But the</s><s id="section33sent2">Practiser needs also Bilhah, “swallowing,” though only as the slave and concubine, for without food and the life which food sustains we cannot have the good life either, since the less good must always serve as foundation for the better.</s><s id="section33sent3">He needs Zilpah too, the gift of language giving expression to the course of an exposition, that the element of words and thoughts may make its twofold contribution to the perfecting process, through the fountain of thought in the mind and the outflow through the tongue and lips.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">Now Abraham and Jacob, as the Holy Scriptures</s><s id="section34sent2">tell us, became the husbands of several women, concubines as well as legitimate wives, but Isaac had neither more wives than one nor any concubine at all, but his lawful wife is the one who shares his home throughout.</s><s id="section34sent3">Why is this?</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">It is because the virtue</s><s id="section35sent2">that comes through teaching, which Abraham pursues, needs the fruits of several studies, both those born in wedlock, which deal with wisdom, and the base-born, those of the preliminary lore of the schools.</s><s id="section35sent3">It is the same with the virtue which is perfected through practice, which Jacob seems to have made his aim.</s><s id="section35sent4">For many and different are the truths in which practice finds its exercising ground, truths which both lead and follow, hasten to meet it and lag behind, and entail sometimes greater, sometimes less</s><s id="section35sent5">labour.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">But the self-learnt kind, of which Isaac is a</s><s id="section36sent2">member, that joy which is the best of the good emotions, is endowed with a simple nature free from mixture and alloy, and wants neither the practice nor the teaching which entails the need of the concubine as well as the legitimate forms of knowledge.</s><s id="section36sent3">When God rains down from heaven the good of which the self is a teacher and learner both, it is impossible that that self should still live in concubinage with the slavish arts, as though desiring to be the father of bastard thoughts and conclusions.</s><s id="section36sent4">He who has obtained this prize is enrolled as the husband of the queen and mistress virtue.</s><s id="section36sent5">Her name in the Greek means “constancy”; in the Hebrew it is Rebecca.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">He who has gained the wisdom that comes without</s><s id="section37sent2">toil and trouble, because his nature is happily gifted and his soul fruitful of good, does not seek for any means of betterment:</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">for he has ready beside him in</s><s id="section38sent2">their fulness the gifts of God, conveyed by the breath of God’s higher graces, but he wishes and prays that these may remain with him constantly.</s><s id="section38sent3">And therefore I think his Benefactor, willing that His graces once received should stay for ever with him, gives him Constancy for his spouse.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">Again, reminiscence takes the second place</s><s id="section39sent2">to memory, and so with the reminded and the rememberer.</s><s id="section39sent3">The conditions of these two resemble respectively continuous health and recovery from disease, for forgetting is a disease of memory.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">The</s><s id="section40sent2">man who is reminded must necessarily have forgotten what he remembered before.</s><s id="section40sent3">So the holy word names memory Ephraim, which by interpretation is “fruit-bearing,” while reminding or reminiscence is called in the Hebrew Manasseh, that is “from</s><s id="section40sent4">forgetfulness.”</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">For it is quite true that the soul of</s><s id="section41sent2">the rememberer has the fruits of what he learned and has lost none of them, whereas the soul of the reminded comes out of forgetfulness which possessed him before he was reminded.</s><s id="section41sent3">The man of memory then is mated to a legitimate wife, memory; the forgetful man to a concubine, reminiscence, Syrian by race, boastful and arrogant, for Syria is by interpretation “loftiness.”</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">This concubine has for a son, in the</s><s id="section42sent2">Hebrew, Machir, meaning with us “the father’s,”
for people who recall to memory think that the father mind was the cause of their being reminded, and do not reflect that this same mind also contained the forgetfulness, for which it would not have had room, if memory were present with it.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">We read, “The</s><s id="section43sent2">sons of Manasseh were those whom the Syrian concubine bore to him, Machir, and Machir begat Gilead” (Gen. xlvi. 20).</s><s id="section43sent3">Nahor too, the brother of Abraham, has two wives, legitimate and concubine, and the name of the legitimate wife was Milcah, and the name of the concubine Reumah (Gen. xxii.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">23, 24).</s><s id="section44sent2">Now let no</s><s id="section44sent3">sane man suppose that we have here in the pages of the wise legislator an historical pedigree.</s><s id="section44sent4">What we have is a revelation through symbols of facts which may be profitable to the soul.</s><s id="section44sent5">And if we translate the names into our own tongue, we shall recognize that what is here promised is actually the case.</s><s id="section44sent6">Let us inquire then into each of them.</s></p></div>
