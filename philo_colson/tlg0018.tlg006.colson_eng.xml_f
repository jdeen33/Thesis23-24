On the Posterity of Cain and His Exile
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“And Cain went out from the face of God, and dwelt in the land of Naid, over against Eden” (Gen. iv. 16).</s><s id="section1sent2">Let us here raise the question whether in the books in which Moses acts as God’s interpreter we ought to take his statements figuratively, since the impression made by the words in their literal sense is greatly at variance with truth.</s><s id="section1sent3">For if the Existent Being has a face, and he that wishes to quit its sight can with perfect ease remove elsewhere, what ground have we for rejecting the impious doctrines of Epicurus,</s><s id="section1sent4">or the atheism of the Egyptians,</s><s id="section1sent5">or the mythical plots of play and poem of which the world is full?</s><s id="section1sent6">For a face is a piece of a living creature, and God is a whole not a part, so that we shall have to assign to Him the other parts of the body as well, neck, breasts, hands, feet, to say nothing of the belly and genital organs, together with the innumerable inner and outer organs.</s><s id="section1sent7">And if God has human forms and parts,</s><s id="section1sent8">He must needs also have human passions and experiences.</s><s id="section1sent9">For in the case of these organs, as in all other cases, Nature has not made idle superfluities, but aids to the weakness of those furnished with them.</s><s id="section1sent10">And she adjusts to them, according to their several needs, all that enables them</s><s id="section1sent11">to render their own special services and ministries.</s><s id="section1sent12">But the Existent Being is in need of nothing, and so, not needing the benefit that parts bestow, can have no parts at all.</s><s id="section1sent13">And whence does Cain “go out”?</s><s id="section1sent14">From the palace of the Lord of all?</s><s id="section1sent15">But what dwelling apparent to the senses could God have, save this world, for the quitting of which no power or device avails?</s><s id="section1sent16">For all created things are enclosed and kept within itself by the circle of the sky.</s><s id="section1sent17">Indeed the particles of the deceased break up into their original elements and are again distributed to the various forces of the universe out of which they were constituted, and the loan which was lent</s><s id="section1sent18">to each man is repaid, after longer or shorter terms, to Nature his creditor, at such time as she may choose to recover what she herself had lent.</s><s id="section1sent19">Again he that goes out from someone is in a different place from him whom he leaves behind.</s><s id="section1sent20">(If, then, Cain goes out from God), it follows that some portions of the universe are bereft of God.</s><s id="section1sent21">Yet God has left nothing empty or destitute of Himself, but has completely filled all things.</s><s id="section1sent22">Well, if God has not a face, transcending as He does the peculiarities that mark all created things; if He is to be found not in some particular part only, seeing that He contains all and is not Himself contained by anything; if it is impossible for some part of this world to remove from it as from a city, seeing that nothing has been left over outside it; the only thing left for us to do is to make up our minds that none of the propositions put forward is literally intended and to take the path of figurative interpretation so dear to philosophical</s><s id="section1sent23">souls.</s><s id="section1sent24">Our argument</s><s id="section1sent25">must start in this way.</s><s id="section1sent26">If it is a difficult thing to remove out of sight of a mortal monarch, must it not be a thousandfold more difficult to quit the vision of God and be gone, resolved henceforth to shun the sight of Him; in other words to become incapable of receiving a mental picture of Him through having lost the sight of the soul’s eye?</s><s id="section1sent27">Men who have suffered this loss under compulsion, overwhelmed by the force of an inexorable power, deserve pity rather than hatred.</s><s id="section1sent28">But those who have of their own free choice turned away and departed from the Existent Being, transcending the utmost limit of wickedness itself—for no evil could be found equivalent to it—these
must pay no ordinary penalties, but such as are specially devised and far beyond the ordinary.</s><s id="section1sent29">Now no effort of thought could hit upon a penalty greater and more unheard of than to go forth into banishment from the Ruler of the Universe.</s><s id="section1sent30">Adam, then, is driven out by God; Cain goes out voluntarily.</s><s id="section1sent31">Moses is showing us each form of moral failure,</s><s id="section1sent32">one of free choice, the other not so.</s><s id="section1sent33">The involuntary act, not owing its existence to our deliberate judgement, is to obtain later on such healing as the case admits of, “for God shall raise up another seed in place of Abel whom Cain slew”
(Gen. iv. 25).</s><s id="section1sent34">This seed is a male offspring, Seth or
“Watering,” raised up to the soul whose fall did not originate in itself.</s><s id="section1sent35">The voluntary act, inasmuch as it was committed with forethought and of set purpose, must incur woes for ever beyond healing.</s><s id="section1sent36">For even as right actions that spring from previous intention are of greater worth than those that are involuntary, so, too, among sins those which are involuntary are less weighty than those which are voluntary.</s><s id="section1sent37">Cain, then, has left the face of God to fall into the hands of Justice who takes vengeance on the impious.</s><s id="section1sent38">But Moses will lay down for his pupils a charge most noble “to love God and hearken to and cleave to Him” (Deut. xxx. 20); assuring them that this is the life that brings true prosperity and length of days.</s><s id="section1sent39">And his way of inviting them to honour Him Who is the worthy object of strong yearning and devoted love is vivid and expressive.</s><s id="section1sent40">He bids them
“cleave to Him,” bringing out by the use of this word how constant and continuous and unbroken is the concord and union that comes through making God our own.</s><s id="section1sent41">These and other exhortations like these does Moses address to others.</s><s id="section1sent42">But so unceasingly does he himself yearn to see God and to be seen by Him, that he implores Him to reveal clearly His own nature (Exod. xxxiii. 13), which is so hard to divine, hoping thus to obtain at length a view free from all falsehood, and to exchange doubt and uncertainty for a most assured confidence.</s><s id="section1sent43">Nor will he abate the intensity of his desire, but although he is aware that he is enamoured of an object which entails a hard quest, nay, which is out of reach, he will nevertheless struggle on with no relaxation of his earnest endeavour, but honestly and resolutely enlisting all his faculties to co-operate for the attainment of his object.</s><s id="section1sent44">So see him enter into the thick darkness where God was (Exod. xx. 21), that is into conceptions regarding the Existent Being that belong to the unapproachable region where there are no material forms.</s><s id="section1sent45">For the Cause of all is not in the thick darkness, nor locally in any place at all, but high above both place and time.</s><s id="section1sent46">For</s><s id="section1sent47">He has placed all</s><s id="section1sent48">creation under</s><s id="section1sent49">His control, and is contained by nothing, but transcends all.</s><s id="section1sent50">But though transcending and being beyond what He has made, none the less has He filled the universe with Himself; for He has caused His powers to extend themselves throughout the Universe to its utmost bounds, and in accordance with the laws of harmony has knit each part to each.</s><s id="section1sent51">When therefore the God-loving soul probes the question of the essence of the Existent Being, he enters on a quest of that which is beyond matter and beyond sight.</s><s id="section1sent52">And out of this quest there accrues to him a vast boon, namely to apprehend that the God of real Being is apprehensible by no one, and to see precisely this, that He is incapable of being seen.</s><s id="section1sent53">But the holy Guide seems to me even before he began this search to have discerned its futility.</s><s id="section1sent54">That he did so is evident from his imploring the Existent One to be His own Interpreter and reveal His own Nature.</s><s id="section1sent55">He says, “Manifest Thyself to me” (Exod. xxxiii. 13), showing quite clearly by so saying that there is not a single created being capable of attaining by his own efforts the knowledge of the God Who verily exists.</s><s id="section1sent56">This must be borne in mind if we are to understand what we read about Abraham, how, on reaching the place of which God had told him, he looked up on the third day and
“seeth the place from afar” (Gen. xxii. 3 f.).</s><s id="section1sent57">What place?</s><s id="section1sent58">The one which he had reached?</s><s id="section1sent59">And how can it be far off if he is already there?</s><s id="section1sent60">It may be that what we are told under a figure is to this effect.</s><s id="section1sent61">The wise man is ever longing to discern the Ruler of the Universe.</s><s id="section1sent62">As he journeys along the path that takes him through knowledge and wisdom, he comes into contact first with divine words, and</s><s id="section1sent63">with these he makes a preliminary stay, and though he had meant to go the remainder of the way, he comes to a stop.</s><s id="section1sent64">For the eyes of his understanding have been opened, and he sees perfectly clearly that he has engaged in the chase of a quarry hard to capture, which always eludes its pursuers and is off to a distance leaving them ever so far behind.</s><s id="section1sent65">Rightly does he reflect that all the fleetest things under the sky would be seen to be standing still, if their motion were compared with that of the sun and moon and the other heavenly bodies.</s><s id="section1sent66">And yet (he ponders) all heaven is God’s handiwork, and that which makes is ever ahead of the thing made: it follows, then, that not only other things with which we are familiar, but that whose movement surpasses them all in swiftness, the mind, would come short of the apprehension of the First Cause by an immeasurable distance.</s><s id="section1sent67">But the strangest thing of all is, that whereas the heavenly bodies as they go past moving objects are themselves in motion, God who outstrips them all is motionless.</s><s id="section1sent68">Yea, we aver that remaining the same</s><s id="section1sent69">He is at once close to us and far from us.</s><s id="section1sent70">He takes hold of us by those forming and chastening powers which are so close to each one of us; and yet He has driven created being far away from His essential Nature, so that we cannot touch it even with the pure spiritual contact of the understanding.</s><s id="section1sent71">With the lovers of God, then, in their quest of the Existent One, even if they never find Him, we rejoice, for the quest of the Good and Beautiful, even if the goal be missed, is sufficient of itself to give a foretaste of gladness.</s><s id="section1sent72">But the self-loving Cain we commiserate, for he has left in the lurch his own soul</s><s id="section1sent73">bereft of any conception of the Existent One, having deliberately blinded the organ by which alone he could have seen Him.</s><s id="section1sent74">It is worth while to notice the country also into which he betakes himself when he has left the presence of God: it is the country called “Tossing.</s><s id="section1sent75">”
In this way the lawgiver indicates that the foolish man, being a creature of wavering and unsettled impulses, is subject to tossing and tumult, like the sea lashed by contrary winds when a storm is raging, and has never even in fancy had experience of quietness and calm.</s><s id="section1sent76">And as at a time when a ship is tossing at the mercy of the sea, it is capable neither of sailing nor of riding at anchor, but pitched about this way and that it rolls in turn to either side and moves uncertainly swaying to and fro; even so the worthless man, with a mind reeling and storm-driven, powerless to direct his course with any steadiness, is always tossing, ready to make shipwreck of his life.</s><s id="section1sent77">I am greatly struck by the perfect sequence of cause and effect in all this.</s><s id="section1sent78">Proximity to a stable object produces a desire to be like it and a longing for quiescence.</s><s id="section1sent79">Now that which is unwaveringly stable is God, and that which is subject to movement is creation.</s><s id="section1sent80">He therefore that draws nigh to God longs for stability, but he that forsakes Him, inasmuch as he approaches the unresting creation is, as we might expect, carried about.</s><s id="section1sent81">It is for this reason that it is written in the Curses “He shall not cause thee to rest, and there shall be no standing for the sole of thy feet,” and a little later “thy life shall be hanging before thine eyes” (Deut. xxviii. 65, 66).</s><s id="section1sent82">For it is the nature of the foolish man to be ever moving contrary to right reason, and to be averse to</s><s id="section1sent83">rest and quietness, and never to plant himself firmly and fixedly on any principle.</s><s id="section1sent84">He has one set of views at one time, another set at another, and sometimes holds conflicting views about the same matters, though no fresh element has been introduced into them.</s><s id="section1sent85">He becomes great and small, foe and friend, and nearly every other pair of opposites in a moment of time.</s><s id="section1sent86">And, as the lawgiver said, his whole life is hanging, with no firm foothold, but always swept off its feet by interests drawing and dragging him in opposite directions.</s><s id="section1sent87">This is why the lawgiver says in another place that “he that hangeth on a tree is cursed of God” (Deut. xxi. 23), for, whereas it behoves us to hang upon God, the man of whom we are thinking suspended himself from his body, which is a log-like mass in us.</s><s id="section1sent88">By doing so he gave up hope and took desire in its place, a grievous evil in place of a supreme good.</s><s id="section1sent89">For hope, being an expectation of good things, fastens the mind upon the bountiful God; whereas desire, infusing irrational cravings, fastens it on the body, which Nature wrought as a receptacle and abode of pleasures.</s><s id="section1sent90">Let such men be hung on desire as from a halter.</s><s id="section1sent91">But Abraham the wise, being one who stands, draws near to God the standing One; for it says “he was standing before the Lord and he drew near and said” (Gen. xviii. 22 f.).</s><s id="section1sent92">For only a truly unchanging soul has access to the unchanging God, and the soul that is of such a disposition does in very deed stand near to the Divine power.</s><s id="section1sent93">But what shows in the clearest light the firm steadfastness of the man of worth is the oracle communicated to the all-wise Moses which runs thus: “But as for thee stand thou here by Me”</s><s id="section1sent94">(Deut. v. 31).</s><s id="section1sent95">This oracle proves two things, one that the Existent Being who moves and turns all else is Himself exempt from movement and turning; and secondly that He makes the worthy man sharer of His own Nature, which is repose.</s><s id="section1sent96">For I take it that, just as crooked things are straightened by a correct ruler, so moving things are brought to a stop and made stationary by the force of Him Who stands.</s><s id="section1sent97">In this case He charges another to stand with Him.</s><s id="section1sent98">Elsewhere</s><s id="section1sent99">He says, “I will go down with thee into Egypt, and will bring thee up at last” (Gen. xlvi. 4).</s><s id="section1sent100">He does not say
“thou with Me.”</s><s id="section1sent101">Why is this?</s><s id="section1sent102">Because quiescence and abiding are characteristic of God, but change of place and all movement that makes for such change is characteristic of creation.</s><s id="section1sent103">When then He invites a man to the good peculiar to Him, He says “Do thou stand with Me,” not “I with thee:” for in God’s case standing is not a future but an ever present act.</s><s id="section1sent104">But when</s><s id="section1sent105">He comes to that which is proper to creation, His words will quite rightly be “I will go down with thee,” for to thee change of place is appropriate.</s><s id="section1sent106">Accordingly with</s><s id="section1sent107">Me no one shall go down—for I know no turning or change—but one shall stand, seeing that quiescence is dear to Me.</s><s id="section1sent108">But with those who go down in the sense of changing their place—for change of place is near of kin to them—I will go down, in all-pervading Presence</s><s id="section1sent109">without any alteration of locality, seeing I have filled the universe with Myself.</s><s id="section1sent110">I do this in pity for rational nature, that it may be caused to rise out of the nether world of the passions into the upper region of virtue guided step by step by Me, Who have laid down the road that leads to</s><s id="section1sent111">heaven and appointed it as a highway for all suppliant souls, that they might not grow weary as they tread it.”</s><s id="section1sent112">Having now shown each side of the picture, calm in a good man, restlessness in a foolish one, let us devote our attention to the sequel.</s><s id="section1sent113">The lawgiver says that Naid, “Tumult,” to which the soul migrated, is over against Eden.</s><s id="section1sent114">“Eden” is a symbolic name for right and divine reason, and so it is literally rendered “luxuriance.”</s><s id="section1sent115">For right reason above all others finds its delight and luxury in the enjoyment of good things pure and undiluted, yea complete and full, while God the Giver of wealth rains down</s><s id="section1sent116">His virgin and deathless boons.</s><s id="section1sent117">And evil is by nature in conflict with good, unjust with just, wise with foolish, and all forms of virtue with all forms of vice.</s><s id="section1sent118">That is the meaning of Naid being over against Eden.</s><s id="section1sent119">Having said this, he says next: “And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch; and Cain was building a city, and he called the city after his son’s name Enoch” (Gen. iv. 17).</s><s id="section1sent120">Is it not reasonable to inquire, what woman Cain knew?</s><s id="section1sent121">For since Eve, who was formed out of Adam’s side, there has been hitherto no record of the creation of any other woman.</s><s id="section1sent122">If anyone should suggest that Cain married his sister, his suggestion will be not only unholy but untrue; for Adam’s daughters are mentioned as having been born at a later time.</s><s id="section1sent123">What then must we say?</s><s id="section1sent124">“Wife” is, I think, the name he gives to the opinion held by an impious man’s reasoning faculty, the opinion which the impious man (habitually) assumes touching (all) matters.</s><s id="section1sent125">So do a host of those who have professed philosophy, some sects agreeing in the rules which they deduce from</s><s id="section1sent126">it for the conduct of life, and some making a variety of deductions.</s><s id="section1sent127">Of what sort then is an impious man’s opinion?</s><s id="section1sent128">That the human mind is the measure of all things, an opinion held they tell us by an ancient sophist named Protagoras, an offspring of Cain’s madness.</s><s id="section1sent129">I gather that by “wife” this opinion is meant from the fact that when Cain knew her she bore Enoch, and Enoch means “thy gift.”</s><s id="section1sent130">For if man is the measure of all things,</s><s id="section1sent131">all things are a present and gift of the mind.</s><s id="section1sent132">It has bestowed on the eye seeing as a favour, on the ears hearing, on each of the other senses their power of perception, yes and speech on the faculty of thought-utterance.</s><s id="section1sent133">But if all these are gifts, so too is thinking, including in itself countless products of thought, resolves, counsels, forethought, comprehension, acquisition of knowledge, skill in arts and in organizing,</s><s id="section1sent134">other faculties too many to recount.</s><s id="section1sent135">Why, pray, are you any longer ready to deliver grave and solemn discourses about holiness and honouring God, and to listen to such discourses from others, seeing that you have with you the mind to take the place of God, and forcibly to appropriate all things human both good and bad, sending to some a blend of both, to others one of the two unmixed?</s><s id="section1sent136">And if someone bring against you an indictment for impiety, you boldly defend yourselves, asserting that you have been trained under an admirable master and instructor, even Cain, who advised you to honour what was near you rather than the far off Cause, and that you are bound to attend to his advice both for other reasons and most of all because he proved the strength of his creed by unmistakable deeds in his victory over Abel, the champion of the opposite opinion, and in getting rid</s><s id="section1sent137">both of him and his opinion.</s><s id="section1sent138">But, in my judgement and in that of my friends, preferable to life with impious men would be death with pious men; for awaiting those who die in this way there will be undying life, but awaiting those who live in that way there will be eternal death.</s><s id="section1sent139">Now since Cain is said to have begotten Enoch, and there is afterwards a descendant of Seth with the name of Enoch again (Gen. iv. 17, v. 18), we must consider whether they were two different persons or the same person.</s><s id="section1sent140">While we are engaged with these, let us investigate also the difference between others who have the same name.</s><s id="section1sent141">Like Enoch, Methuselah and Lamech appear as descendants of Cain, and descendants no less of Seth (Gen. iv. 18, v. 21, 25).</s><s id="section1sent142">It is important, then, that we should know that each of the names mentioned has a meaning that can be taken in two ways.</s><s id="section1sent143">“Enoch,” as I have already said, means “thy gift,” “Methuselah” “a sending forth of death,” and “Lamech” “humiliation.”</s><s id="section1sent144">Take the first.</s><s id="section1sent145">Thy gift is, on some people’s lips, an address to the mind within us; on the lips of the better kind of men it is addressed to the universal Mind.</s><s id="section1sent146">Those who assert that everything that is involved in thought or perception or speech is a free gift of their own soul, seeing that they introduce an impious and atheistic opinion, must be assigned to the race of Cain, who, while incapable even of ruling himself, made bold to say that he had full possession of all other things as well.</s><s id="section1sent147">But those who do not claim as their own all that is fair in creation, but acknowledge all as due to the gift of God, being men of real nobility, sprung not from a long line of rich ancestors but from lovers of virtue, must remain</s><s id="section1sent148">enrolled under Seth as the head of their race.</s><s id="section1sent149">This sort is very hard to find, since they make their escape from a life beset with passions and vices, with its treachery and unscrupulousness, its villainy and dissoluteness.</s><s id="section1sent150">For those who have been well-pleasing

for insolence, the daughter of satiety and greediness, never fails to be immediately engendered.</s><s id="section1sent331">As we might expect, then, the man who alters the make and character of all good things is father of those whose interest is concentrated on everything that is soul-less and an object only of the senses.</s><s id="section1sent332">For, had he taken as the object of his quest the incorporeal natures that come under the cognizance of the mind, he would have</s><s id="section1sent333">kept to the limits laid down by the men of old, which they laid down in the cause of virtue, stamping each form of it with the impress belonging to it.</s><s id="section1sent334">Jubal, the lawgiver tells us, was the brother of Jobel (Gen. iv. 21).</s><s id="section1sent335">“Jubal” is akin in meaning to “Jobel,” for it means “inclining now this way now that,” and it is a figure for the uttered word, which is in its nature brother to mind.</s><s id="section1sent336">It is a most appropriate name for the utterance of a mind that alters the make of things, for its way is to halt between two courses, swaying up and down as if on a pair of scales, or like a boat at sea, struck by huge waves and rolling towards either side.</s><s id="section1sent337">For the foolish man has never learned to say anything sure or well-grounded.</s><s id="section1sent338">Moses thinks that none ought to turn away either to the right or to the left or to the parts of the earthly Edom at all, but to go by along the central road, to which he gives the most proper title of the king’s highway or royal road; for since God is the first and sole King of the universe, the road leading to Him, being a King’s road, is also naturally called royal.</s><s id="section1sent339">This road you must take to be philosophy, not the philosophy which is pursued by the sophistic group of present-day people, who, having practised arts of speech to use against the truth, have given the name of wisdom to their rascality, conferring on a sorry work a divine title.</s><s id="section1sent340">No, the philosophy which the ancient band of aspirants pursued in hard-fought contest, eschewing the soft enchantments of pleasure, engaged with a fine severity in the study of what is good and fair.</s><s id="section1sent341">This royal road then, which we have just said to be true and genuine philosophy, is called in the Law the utterance and word of God.</s><s id="section1sent342">For it is written
“Thou shalt not swerve aside from the word which</s><s id="section1sent343">I command thee this day to the right hand nor to the left hand” (Deut. xxviii. 14).</s><s id="section1sent344">Thus it is clearly proved that the word of God is identical with the royal road.</s><s id="section1sent345">He treats the two as synonymous, and bids us decline from neither, but with upright mind tread the track that leads straight on, a central highway.</s><s id="section1sent346">“This Jubal,” he says, “is a father who invented psaltery and harp” (Gen. iv. 21).</s><s id="section1sent347">Most appropriately does he give to sounding speech the title of father of music and of all musical instruments.</s><s id="section1sent348">For nature, when she had wrought for living creatures the organ or instrument of sound as chief and most perfect of all instruments, went on at once to bestow upon it the concords and the various kinds of melodies to the end that it might be a pattern made ready beforehand for the instruments that were to be fashioned artificially.</s><s id="section1sent349">So too with the ear.</s><s id="section1sent350">Nature turned it with her lathe and made it spherical, drawing circles within circles, lesser within larger, in order that the sound that approached it might not escape and be dispersed outside of it, but that the thing heard might be collected and enclosed within by the circles, and being as it were poured through them, be conveyed into the receptacles of the mind.</s><s id="section1sent351">We see here at once a model for the theatres seen in thriving cities, for theatres are constructed in exact imitation of the shape of the ear.</s><s id="section1sent352">So Nature, who fashioned living creatures, stretched the windpipe as though a musical scale, combining in it the enharmonic and chromatic and diatonic modes, answering to the vast variety of melodies with their shorter or longer intervals, and in this way set up a pattern of every musical instrument.</s><s id="section1sent353">To show how true this</s><s id="section1sent354">is, I may mention that all the melodious sounds produced by wind-and stringed-instruments fall as far short of the music that comes from nightingales and swans, as a copy and imitation falls short of an original, or a perishable species of an imperishable genus.</s><s id="section1sent355">For we cannot compare the music produced by the human voice with that produced in any other way, since it has the pre-eminent gift of articulation, for which it is prized.</s><s id="section1sent356">For whereas the other kinds by use of the modulation of the voice and the successive changes of the notes can do no more than produce sounds pleasing to the ear, man, having been endowed by nature with articulate utterance equally for speaking and for singing, attracts alike both ear and mind, charming the one by the tune, and gaining the attention of the other by the thoughts expressed.</s><s id="section1sent357">For just as an instrument put into the hands of an unmusical person is tuneless, but in the hands of a musician answers to the skill which he possesses and becomes tuneful, in exactly the same way speech set in motion by a worthless mind is without tune, but when set going by a worthy one is discovered to be in perfect tune.</s><s id="section1sent358">Moreover, a lyre or anything of that kind, unless struck by someone, is still: speech too, if not struck by the ruling faculty, of necessity maintains silence.</s><s id="section1sent359">Moreover, just as instruments are tuned to vary in accordance with the infinite number of combinations of the music which they have to give forth, so speech proves itself an harmonious interpreter of the matters dealt with and admits of endless variations.</s><s id="section1sent360">For who would talk in the same way to parents and children, being slave of the former by nature, and master of the latter in virtue of the same cause?</s><s id="section1sent361">Who would speak in the same</s><s id="section1sent362">way to brothers, cousins, near relatives generally, and to those only distantly connected with him?</s><s id="section1sent363">to those associated with him, and to those with whom he has nothing to do; to fellow-citizens and foreigners; to people differing in no slight or ordinary degree in nature or age?</s><s id="section1sent364">For we have to talk in one way to an old man, in another to a young one, and again in one way to a man of importance and in another to an insignificant person, and so with rich and poor, official and non-official, servant and master, woman and man, skilled and unskilled.</s><s id="section1sent365">What need to make a list of the innumerable sorts of persons, in our conversation with whom our talk varies, taking one shape at one time, another at another?</s><s id="section1sent366">For indeed the same thing is true of subjects of thought.</s><s id="section1sent367">Their several peculiarities mould our language in conformity with their characteristic aspects; for it would not set forth great things and little, many and few, private and public, sacred and profane, ancient and modern, in the same style, but in the style suited to their respective number or importance or greatness; at one time rising to a lofty tone, at another restraining and holding itself in.</s><s id="section1sent368">Nor is it only persons and matters dealt with that occasion our speech to vary its form, but the causes too of the things that happen, and the ways in which they happen, and besides these, times and places which enter into all things.</s><s id="section1sent369">Right well then is Jubal, the man who alters the tone and trend of speech, spoken of as the father of psaltery and harp, that is of music, the part being used for the whole, as has been made evident.</s><s id="section1sent370">We have now described the progeny of Ada and who

instance of this attitude is afforded by certain persons who have dared before now to say that they did not know the true God (Exod. v. 2), forgetting in their excessive enjoyment of bodily and outward things that they were but men.</s><s id="section1sent388">Accurately characterizing each one of these he goes on to say: “This man was a wielder of the hammer, a smith in brass and iron work (Gen. iv. 22).</s><s id="section1sent389">For the soul that is vehemently concerned about bodily pleasures or the materials of outward things, is being ever hammered on an anvil, beaten out by the blows of his desires with their long swoop and reach.</s><s id="section1sent390">Always and everywhere you may see those who care for their bodies more than anything else setting lines and snares to catch the things they long for.</s><s id="section1sent391">You may see lovers of money and fame dispatching on expeditions to the ends of the earth and beyond the sea the frenzied craving for these

something,</s><s id="section1sent395">or, in a word, to gain advantages pertaining to the body and outward things.</s><s id="section1sent396">But for the sake of culture and virtue, which are goods of the mind, the noblest part of our being, no war either foreign or civil has ever yet broken out; for these things are by nature peaceful; and when they prevail, a settled condition of society, and the reign of law, and all things fairest to behold, meet, not the body’s dim-eyed vision, but the keen sight of the soul.</s><s id="section1sent397">For while the bodily eyes see only the outward surface,

among men scarcely ever about anything else than what is in reality a shadow.</s><s id="section1sent399">For the lawgiver named the manufacturer of weapons of war, of brass and iron, Thobel son of Sella the shadow, and his philosophy depends not on verbal artifices, but on surpassing beauty of conception.</s><s id="section1sent400">For he was aware that every naval or land force chooses the greatest dangers for the sake of bodily pleasures or to gain a superabundance of things outward, no one of which is proved sure and stable by all-testing time; for those things resemble pictures that

those, who make bodily comfort and the material things of which I have spoken their object, succeed in getting something which they crave after, the consequence is that they grow fat.</s><s id="section1sent402">Such fatness I for my part set down not as strength but as weakness,</s><s id="section1sent403">for it teaches us to neglect to pay honour to God, which is the chiefest and best

but the Lord is among us “(Numb. xiv. 9).</s><s id="section1sent407">From this we see that the Divine word dwells and walks among those for whom the soul’s life is an object of honour, while those who value the life given to its pleasures, experience good times that are transient and fictitious.</s><s id="section1sent408">These, suffering from the effects of fatness and enjoyment spreading increasingly, swell out and become distended till they burst; but those who are fattened by wisdom which feeds souls that are lovers of virtue, acquire a firm and settled vigour, of which the fat taken from every sacrifice to be offered with the whole burnt offering is a sign.</s><s id="section1sent409">For Moses says
“all the fat is a due for ever to the Lord” (Lev. iii. 16 f.), showing that richness of mind is recognized as God’s gift and appropriated to Him, and thus attains to immortality; while that of the body and outward things is ascribed to the fair moment that usurps the place of God, and for this reason quickly has passed its prime.</s><s id="section1sent410">The subject of Lamech and his wives and progeny has, I think, been adequately dealt with.</s><s id="section1sent411">Let us consider what may be called the new birth of</s><s id="section1sent412">the murdered Abel. “Adam,” it says.</s><s id="section1sent413">“knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare a son, and called his name Seth (saying):</s><s id="section1sent414">God hath raised up to me another seed in the place of Abel, whom Cain slew”

for the word of God is the source and spring of noble conduct.</s><s id="section1sent423">The lawgiver intimates as much by the words: “A river goeth out of Eden to water the garden.</s><s id="section1sent424">From thence it is parted into four heads” (Gen. ii. 10).</s><s id="section1sent425">For there</s><s id="section1sent426">are four main virtues, wisdom, courage, temperance, justice.</s><s id="section1sent427">Each one of these is a sovereign wielding authority, and the man that has acquired them is by the mere fact of doing so a ruling monarch, even if he be destitute of material resources.</s><s id="section1sent428">For the phrase “is parted into four heads” is not meant to indicate a dividing asunder,</s><s id="section1sent429">but a sway and sovereignty belonging to virtues.</s><s id="section1sent430">These have sprung from the Divine word as from a single root;
