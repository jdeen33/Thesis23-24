On the Life of Moses, Book I
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section2sent1">I purpose to write the life of Moses, whom somedescribe as the legislator of the Jews, others as the interpreter of the Holy Laws.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section3sent1">I hope to bring the story of this greatest and most perfect of men to the knowledge of such as deserve not to remain in ignorance of it; for, while the fame of the lawswhich he left behind him has travelled throughout the civilized world and reached the ends of the earth, the man himself as he really was is known to few.</s><s id="Book0section3sent2">Greek men of letters have refused to treat him as worthy of memory, possibly through envy, and also because in many cases the ordinances of the legislators of the different states are opposed to his.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section4sent1">Mostof these authors have abused the powers which education gave them, by composing in verse or prose comedies and pieces of voluptuous licence, to their widespread disgrace, when they should have used their natural gifts to the full on the lessons taught by good men and their lives.</s><s id="Book0section4sent2">In this way they might have ensured that nothing of excellence, old or new, should be consigned to oblivion and to the extinction of the light which it could give, and also save themselves from seeming to neglect the better themes and prefer others unworthy of attention, in which all their efforts to express bad matter in good language served to confer distinction on shamefulsubjects.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section5sent1">But I will disregard their malice, and tellthe story of Moses as I have learned it, both from the sacred books, the wonderful monuments of his wisdom which he has left behind him, and from some of the elders of the nation; for I always interwove what I was told with what I read, and thus believed myself to have a closer knowledge than others of his life’s history.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section6sent1">I will begin with what is necessarily the rightplace to begin.</s><s id="Book0section6sent2">Moses was by race a Chaldean, but was born and reared in Egypt, as his ancestors had migrated thither to seek food with their whole households, in consequence of the long famine under which Babylon and the neighbouring populations were suffering.</s><s id="Book0section6sent3">Egypt is a land rich in plains, with deep soil, and very productive of all that human nature needs, and particularly of corn.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section7sent1">For the riverof this country, in the height of summer, when other streams, whether winter torrents or spring-fed, are said to dwindle, rises and overflows, and its flood makes a lake of the fields which need no rain but every year bear a plentiful crop of good produce of every kind, if not prevented by some visitation of the wrath of God to punish the prevailing impiety of the inhabitants.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section8sent1">He had for his father andmother the best of their contemporaries, members of the same tribe, though with them mutual affection was a stronger tie than family connexions.</s><s id="Book0section8sent2">He was seventh in descent from the first settler, who became the founder of the whole Jewish nation.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section9sent1">He was brought up as a prince, a promotiondue to the following cause.</s><s id="Book0section9sent2">As the nation of thenewcomers was constantly growing more numerous, the king of the country, fearing that the settlers, thus increasing, might shew their superiority by contesting the chief power with the original inhabitants, contrived a most iniquitous scheme to deprive them of their strength.</s><s id="Book0section9sent3">He gave orders to rear the female infants, since her natural weakness makes a woman inactive in war, but to put the males to death, to prevent their number increasing throughout the cities; for a flourishing male population is a coign of vantage to an aggressor which cannot easily be taken or destroyed.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section10sent1">Now, the child fromhis birth had an appearance of more than ordinary goodliness,so that his parents as long as they could actually set at nought the proclamations of the despot.</s><s id="Book0section10sent2">In fact we are told that, unknown to all but few, he was kept at home and fed from his mother’s breast for three successive months.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section11sent1">But, since as isoften the case under a monarch, there were persons prying into holes and corners, ever eager to carry some new report to the king, his parents in their fear that their efforts to save one would but cause a larger number, namely themselves, to perish with him, exposed him with tears on the banks of the river, and departed groaning.</s><s id="Book0section11sent2">They pitied themselves being forced, as they said in their self-reproach, to be the murderers of their own child, and they pitied him too, left to perish in this unnatural way.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section12sent1">Then, as was natural in so strangely cruel asituation, they began to accuse themselves of having made bad worse.</s><s id="Book0section12sent2">“Why did we not cast him away,” they said, “directly he was born?</s><s id="Book0section12sent3">The child who has not survived to enjoy a kind nurture is not usually reckoned as a human being.</s><s id="Book0section12sent4">But we meddlersactually nurtured him for three whole months, thus procuring more abundant affliction for ourselves and torture for him, only that when he was fully capable of feeling pleasure and pain he should perish conscious of the increased misery of his sufferings.”</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section13sent1">While they departed ignorant of the future,overcome by grief and sorrow, the sister of the infant castaway, a girl still unmarried, moved by family affection, remained at a little distance, waiting to see what would happen, all this being brought about, in my opinion, by the providence of God watching over the child.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section14sent1">The king of the country had butone cherished daughter, who, we are told, had been married for a considerable time but had never conceived a child, though she naturally desired one, particularly of the male sex, to succeed to the magnificent inheritance of her father’s kingdom, which threatened to go to strangers if his daughter gave him no grandson.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section15sent1">Depressed and loud in lamentationshe always was, but on this particular day she broke down under the weight of cares; and, though her custom was to remain at home and never even cross the threshold, she set off with her maids to the river, where the child was exposed.</s><s id="Book0section15sent2">Then, as she was preparing to make her ablutions in the purifying water, she saw him lying where the marshland growth was thickest, and bade him be brought to her.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section16sent1">Thereupon,surveying him from head to foot, she approved of his beauty and fine condition, and seeing him weeping took pity on him, for her heart was now moved to feel for him as a mother for her own child.</s><s id="Book0section16sent2">And, recognizing that he belonged to the Hebrews, who were intimidated by the king’s orders, she considered how to have him nursed, for at present it was not safe to take him to the palace.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section17sent1">Whileshe was still thus debating, the child’s sister, who guessed her difficulty, ran up from where she stood like a scout, and asked whether she would like to take for his foster-mother a Hebrew woman who had lately been with child.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section18sent1">When the princess agreed,she brought her own and the babe’s mother in the guise of a stranger, who readily and gladly promised to nurse him, ostensibly for wages.</s><s id="Book0section18sent2">Thus, by God’s disposing, it was provided that the child’s first nursing should come from the natural source.</s><s id="Book0section18sent3">Since he had been taken up from the water, the princess gave him a name derived from this,and called him Moses, for Möu is the Egyptian word for water.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section19sent1">As he grew and thrived without a break, andwas weaned at an earlier date than they had reckoned, his mother and nurse in one brought him to her from whom she had received him, since he had ceased to need an infant’s milk.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section20sent1">He was noble and goodly to look upon; and the princess, seeing him so advancedbeyond his age, conceived for him an even greater fondness than before, and took him for her son, having at an earlier time artificially enlarged the figure of her womb to make him pass as her real and not a supposititious child.</s><s id="Book0section20sent2">God makes all that He wills easy, however difficult be the accomplishment.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section21sent1">So now he received as his right the nurture andservice due to a prince.</s><s id="Book0section21sent2">Yet he did not bear himselflike the mere infant that he was, nor delight in fun and laughter and sport, though those who had the charge of him did not grudge him relaxation or shew him any strictness;but with a modest and serious bearing he applied himself to hearing and seeing what was sure to profit the soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section22sent1">Teachers at oncearrived from different parts, some unbidden from the neighbouring countries and the provinces of Egypt, others summoned from Greece under promise of high reward.</s><s id="Book0section22sent2">But in a short time he advanced beyond their capacities; his gifted nature forestalled their instruction, so that his seemed a case rather of recollection than of learning, and indeed he himself devised and propounded problems which they could not easily solve.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section23sent1">For great natures carveout much that is new in the way of knowledge; and, just as bodies, robust and agile in every part, free their trainers from care, and receive little or none of their usual attention, and in the same way well-grown and naturally healthy trees, which improve of themselves, give the husbandmen no trouble, so the gifted soul takes the lead in meeting the lessons given by itself rather than the teacher and is profited thereby, and as soon as it has a grasp of some of the first principles of knowledge presses forward like the horse to the meadow,as the proverb goes.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section24sent1">Arithmetic,geometry, the lore of metre, rhythm and harmony, and the whole subject of music as shown by the use of instruments or in textbooks and treatises of a more special character, were imparted to him by learned Egyptians.</s><s id="Book0section24sent2">These further instructedhim in the philosophy conveyed in symbols, as displayed in the so-called holy inscriptions and in the regard paid to animals, to which they even pay divine honours.</s><s id="Book0section24sent3">He had Greeks to teach him the rest of the regular school course,and the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries for Assyrian lettersand the Chaldean science of the heavenly bodies.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section25sent1">This he also acquired from Egyptians,whogive special attention to astrology.</s><s id="Book0section25sent2">And, when he had mastered the lore of both nations, both where they agree and where they differ, he eschewed all strife and contention and sought only for truth.</s><s id="Book0section25sent3">His mind was incapable of accepting any falsehood, as is the way with the sectarians, who defend the doctrines they have propounded, whatever they may be, without examining whether they can stand scrutiny, and thus put themselves on a par with hired advocates who have no thought nor care for justice.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section26sent1">When he was now passing beyond the term ofboyhood, his good sense became more active.</s><s id="Book0section26sent2">He did not, as some, allow the lusts of adolescence to go unbridled, though the abundant resources which palaces provide supply numberless incentives to foster their flame.</s><s id="Book0section26sent3">But he kept a tight hold on them with the reins, as it were, of temperance and self-control, and forcibly pulled them back from their forward course.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section27sent1">And each of the other passions,which rage so furiously if left to themselves, he tamed and assuaged and reduced to mildness; and if they did but gently stir or flutter he provided for them heavier chastisement than any rebuke of wordscould give; and in general he watched the first directions and impulses of the soul as one would a restive horse, in fear lest they should run away with the reason which ought to rein them in, and thus cause universal chaos.</s><s id="Book0section27sent2">For it is these impulses which cause both good and bad—good when they obey the guidance of reason, bad when they turn from their regular course into anarchy.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section28sent1">Naturally, there-fore,his associates and everyone else, struck with amazement at what they felt was a novel spectacle, considered earnestly what the mind which dwelt in his body like an image in its shrine could be, whether it was human or divine or a mixture of both, so utterly unlike was it to the majority, soaring above them and exalted to a grander height.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section29sent1">For on hisbelly he bestowed no more than the necessary tributes which nature has appointed, and as for the pleasures that have their seat below, save for the lawful begetting of children, they passed altogether even out of his memory.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section30sent1">And, in his desire to liveto the soul alone and not to the body, he made a special practice of frugal contentment, and had an unparalleled scorn for a life of luxury.</s><s id="Book0section30sent2">He exemplified his philosophical creed by his daily actions.</s><s id="Book0section30sent3">His words expressed his feelings, and his actions accorded with his words, so that speech and life were in harmony, and thus through their mutual agreement were found to make melody together as on a musical intrument.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section31sent1">Now, most men,if they feel a breath of prosperity ever so small upon them, make much ado of puffing and blowing, and boast themselves as bigger than meaner men, and miscall them offscourings and nuisances and cumberers of the earth and other suchlike names, as ifthey themselves had the permanence of their prosperity securely sealed in their possession, though even the morrow may find them no longer where they are.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section32sent1">For nothing is more unstable than Fortune,who moves human affairs up and down on the draughtboard of life, and in a single day pulls down the lofty and exalts the lowly on high;and though they see and know full well that this is always happening, they nevertheless look down on their relations and friends and set at naught the laws under which they were born and bred, and subvert the ancestral customs to which no blame can justly attach, by adopting different modes of life, and, in their contentment with the present, lose all memory of the past.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section33sent1">But Moses, havingreached the very pinnacle of human prosperity, regarded as the son of the king’s daughter, and in general expectation almost the successor to his grandfather’s sovereignty, and indeed regularly called the young king, was zealous for the discipline and culture of his kinsmen and ancestors.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section34sent1">The good fortune of his adopters, he held, was a spurious one, even though the circumstances gave it greater lustre; that of his natural parents, though less distinguished for the nonce, was at any rate his own and genuine; and so,estimating the claims of his real and his adopted parents like an impartial judge, he requited the former with good feeling and profound affection, the latter with gratitude for their kind treatment of him.</s><s id="Book0section34sent2">And he would have continued to do so throughout had he not found the king adopting in the country a new and highly impious course of action.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section35sent1">The Jews,
 as I have said before, were
strangers, since famine had driven the founders of the nation, through lack of food, to migrate to Egypt from Babylon and the inland satrapies.</s><s id="Book0section35sent2">They were, in a sense, suppliants, who had found a sanctuary in the pledged faith of the king and the pity felt for them by the inhabitants.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section36sent1">For strangers, in myjudgement, must be regarded as suppliants of those who receive them, and not only suppliants but settlers and friends who are anxious to obtain equal rights with the burgesses and are near to being citizens because they differ little from the original inhabitants.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section37sent1">So, then, these strangers, who had lefttheir own country and come to Egypt hoping to live there in safety as in a second fatherland, were made slaves by the ruler of the country and reduced to the condition of captives taken by the custom of war, or persons purchased from the masters in whose household they had been bred.</s><s id="Book0section37sent2">And in thus making serfs of men who were not only free but guests, suppliants and settlers, he showed no shame or fear of the God of liberty and hospitality and of justice to guests and suppliants,Who watches over such as these.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section38sent1">Then he laid commands upon them, severebeyond their capacity, and added labour to labour; and, when they failed through weakness, the iron hand was upon them; for he chose as superintendents of the works men of the most cruel and savage temper who showed no mercy to anyone, men whose name of “task-pursuer” well described the facts.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section39sent1">Some of the workers wrought clay into brick, whileothers fetched from every quarter straw which servedto bind the brick.</s><s id="Book0section39sent2">Others were appointed to build houses and walls and cities or to cut canals.</s><s id="Book0section39sent3">They carried the materials themselves day and night, with no shifts to relieve them, no period of rest, not even suffered just to sleep for a bit and then resume their work.</s><s id="Book0section39sent4">In fact, they were compelled to do all the work, both of the artisan and his assistants, so that in a short time loss of heart was followed necessarily by bodily exhaustion.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section40sent1">This was shown by the wayin which they died one after the other, as though they were the victims of a pestilence, to be flung unburied outside the borders by their masters, who did not allow the survivors even to collect dust to throw upon the corpses or even to shed tears for their kinsfolk or friends thus pitifully done to death.</s><s id="Book0section40sent2">And, though nature has given to the untrammelled feelings of the soul a liberty which she has denied to almost everything else, they impiously threatened to exert their despotism over these also and suppressed them with the intolerable weight of a constraint more powerful than nature.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section41sent1">All this continued to depress and angerMoses, who had no power either to punish those who did the wrong or help those who suffered it.</s><s id="Book0section41sent2">What he could he did.</s><s id="Book0section41sent3">He assisted with his words, exhorting the overseers to show clemency and relax and alleviate the stringency of their orders, and the workers to bear their present condition bravely, to display a manly spirit and not let their souls share the weariness of their bodies, but look for good to take the place of evil.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section42sent1">All things in the world, he toldthem, change to their opposites: clouds to open sky, violent winds to tranquil weather, stormy seas to calm and peaceful, and human affairs still more so,even as they are more unstable.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section43sent1">With such soothingwords, like a good physician, he thought to relieve the sickness of their plight, terrible as it was.</s><s id="Book0section43sent2">But, when it abated, it did but turn and make a fresh attack and gather from the breathing-space some new misery more powerful than its predecessors.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section44sent1">For some of the overseers were exceedingly harshand ferocious, in savageness differing nothing from venomous and carnivorous animals, wild beasts in human shape who assumed in outward form the semblance of civilized beings only to beguile and catch their prey, in reality more unyielding than iron or adamant.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section45sent1">One of these, the cruellest of all, waskilled by Moses, because he not only made no concession but was rendered harsher than ever by his exhortations, beating those who did not execute his orders with breathless promptness, persecuting them to the point of death and subjecting them to every outrage.</s><s id="Book0section45sent2">Moses considered that his action in killing him was a righteous action.</s><s id="Book0section45sent3">And righteous it was that one who only lived to destroy men should himself be destroyed.</s><s id="Book0section45sent4">When the king heard this, he was very indignant.</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section46sent1">What he felt so strongly was not that one man had been killed by another whether justly or unjustly, but that his own daughter’s son did not think with him, and had not considered the king’s friends and enemies to be his own friends and enemies, but hated those of whom he was fond, and loved those whom he rejected, and pitied those to whom he was relentless and inexorable.</s></p></div>
<div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section47sent1">Whenthose in authority who suspected the youth’s intentions, knowing that he would remember their wicked actions against them and take vengeancewhen the opportunity came, had thus once got a handle, they poured malicious suggestions by the thousand from every side into the open ears of his grandfather, so as to instil the fear that his sovereignty might be taken from him.</s><s id="Book0section47sent2">“He will attack you,” they said, “he is highly ambitious.</s><s id="Book0section47sent3">He is always busy with some further project.</s><s id="Book0section47sent4">He is eager to get the kingship before the time comes.</s><s id="Book0section47sent5">He flatters some, threatens others, slays without trial and treats as outcasts those who are most loyal to you.</s><s id="Book0section47sent6">Why do you hesitate, instead of cutting short his projected undertakings?</s><s id="Book0section47sent7">The aggressor is greatly served by delay on the part of his proposed victim.”</s></p></div>
<div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section48sent1">While such talk was in circulation, Moses retiredinto the neighbouring country of Arabia, where it was safe for him to stay, at the same time beseeching God to save the oppressed from their helpless, miserable plight, and to punish as they deserved the oppressors who had left no form of maltreatment untried, and to double the gift by granting to himself that he should see both these accomplished.</s><s id="Book0section48sent2">God, in high approval of his spirit, which loved the good and hated evil, listened to his prayers, and very shortly judged the land and its doings as became His nature.</s></p></div>
<div n="48" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section49sent1">But, while the divine judgement was still waiting,Moses was carrying out the exercises of virtue with an admirable trainer, the reason within him, under whose discipline he laboured to fit himself for life in its highest forms, the theoretical and the practical.</s><s id="Book0section49sent2">He was ever opening the scroll of philosophical doctrines, digested them inwardly with quick understanding, committed them to memory never to be forgotten, and straightway brought his personal conduct,praiseworthy in all respects, into conformity with them; for he desired truth rather than seeming, because the one mark he set before him was nature’s right reason, the sole source and fountain of virtues.</s></p></div>
<div n="49" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section50sent1">Now, any other who was fleeing fromthe king’s relentless wrath, and had just arrived for the first time in a foreign land, who had not yet become familiar with the customs of the natives nor gained exact knowledge of what pleases or offends them, might well have been eager to keep quiet and live in obscurity unnoticed by the multitude; or else he might have wished to come forward in public, and by obsequious persistence court the favour of men of highest authority and power, if none others, men who might be expected to give help and succour should some come and attempt to carry him off by force.</s></p></div>

<div n="120" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section455sent1">Theirposition testifies most clearly to this explanation.</s><s id="Book0section455sent2">For, just as the pomegranates, the flower trimming and the bells are at the extremities of the long robe, so too what these symbolize, namely earth and water, occupy the lowest place in the universe, and in unison with the harmony of the All display their several powers at fixed revolutions of time and at their proper seasons.</s></p></div>

<div n="122" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section457sent1">As for the ephod, consideration following whatprobability suggests will represent it as a symbol of heaven.</s><s id="Book0section457sent2">For first the two circular emerald stoneson the shoulder-pieces indicate, as some think, those heavenly bodies which rule the day and night, namely the sun and moon, or, as may be said with a nearer approach to truth, the two hemispheres of the sky.</s><s id="Book0section457sent3">For, just as the stones are equal to each other, so is the hemisphere above to that below the earth, and neither is so constituted as to increase and dimmish as does the moon.</s></p></div>

<div n="129" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section464sent1">At the same time, as in each of us,reason has two forms, the outward of utterance and the inward of thought, he gave them each one of the two virtues as its special property; to utterance clear shewing, to the thinking mind truth.</s><s id="Book0section464sent2">For it is the duty of the thinking faculty to admit no falsehood,and of the language faculty to give free play to all that helps to shew facts clearly with the utmost exactness.</s></p></div>

<div n="131" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section466sent1">Such are the ideas which he suggests underthe figure of the sacred vesture; but, in setting a turban on the priest’s head, instead of a diadem, he expresses his judgement that he who is consecrated to God is superior when he acts as a priest to all others, not only the ordinary laymen, but even kings.</s></p></div>
