On the Virtues
On Virtues Which Together With Others Were Described By Moses or on Courage And Piety and Humanity and Repentance

 
On Courage
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">The subject of justice and all the relevant points</s><s id="section1sent2">which the occasion requires have already been discussed, and I will take courage next in the sequence.</s><s id="section1sent3">By courage I mean, not what most people understand, namely the rabid war fever which takes anger for its counsellor, but the courage which is knowledge.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">For some under the stimulus of reckless daring, supported</s><s id="section2sent2">by bodily strength and marshalled in full armour for war, lay low multitudes of antagonists in a general slaughter and win the well-sounding but little deserved name of noble achievement, yet though their victory makes them exceedingly glorious in the eyes of those who pass judgement on such matters, nature and practice have combined to make them savage and bestial in their thirst for human blood.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">But there are others who live on in</s><s id="section3sent2">their homes with their bodies worn to a thread by long sickness or the burden of old age, yet healthy</s><s id="section3sent3">and youthful in the better part of the soul,</s><s id="section3sent4">brimful of highmindedness and staunchest valour.</s><s id="section3sent5">They never even dream of touching weapons of defence, but render the highest service to the commonwealth by the excellent advice which they put forward, and guided by unflinching and unswerving consideration of what is profitable, restore what had broken down in the personal life of each individual and in the public life of their country.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">These then</s><s id="section4sent2">who train themselves in wisdom cultivate the true courage.</s><s id="section4sent3">The courage of those others, whose life is distempered by an ignorance that resists all treatment, is falsely so named and should properly be called reckless daring, as in the case of coins where we say that the counterfeit is a likeness of the true type.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Further there are many other conditions in</s><s id="section5sent2">human life admittedly hard to bear, poverty and disrepute and disablement and sickness in its manifold forms, in the face of which those of little wit all grow craven-hearted, lacking the valour even to raise themselves.</s><s id="section5sent3">But those who are full of wisdom and highmindedness gallantly gird themselves for the struggle and resist the foe with all their strength, counting his</s><s id="section5sent4">threats and menaces a matter for much scorn and derision.</s><s id="section5sent5">Against poverty they pit riches, not the blind but the keen-sighted riches,</s><s id="section5sent6">whose jewels and treasures have their natural store-house in the soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">For under the grip of poverty multitudes have been</s><s id="section6sent2">laid low, and like exhausted athletes have fallen to the ground enfeebled by lack of manliness.</s><s id="section6sent3">Yet in the judgement of truth not a single one is in want, for his needs are supplied by the wealth of nature,</s><s id="section6sent4">which cannot be taken from him; the air, the first, the most vital, the perpetual source of sustenance, which we inhale continually night and day; then the fountains in their profusion and the rivers spring-fed as well as winter brooks ever flowing to provide us with drink; then again for our meat, the harvest of crops of every sort, and the different kinds of trees, which never fail to bear their annual autumn fruitage.</s><s id="section6sent5">These no one lacks, but everybody everywhere has an ample and more than ample sufficiency.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">But some making no account of the</s><s id="section7sent2">wealth of nature pursue the wealth of vain opinions.</s><s id="section7sent3">They choose to lean on one who lacks rather than one who has the gift of sight, and with this defective guidance to their steps must of necessity fall.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">So much for the wealth that is the guardsman</s><s id="section8sent2">of the body, the happy gift of nature,</s><s id="section8sent3">but we must mention also the higher, nobler wealth, which does not belong to all, but to truly noble and divinely</s><s id="section8sent4">gifted men.</s><s id="section8sent5">This wealth is bestowed by wisdom through the doctrines and principles of ethic, logic and physic,</s><s id="section8sent6">and from these spring the virtues, which rid the soul of its proneness to extravagance, and engender the love of contentment and frugality, which will assimilate it to God.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">For God has no</s><s id="section9sent2">wants,</s><s id="section9sent3">He needs nothing, being in Himself all-sufficient to Himself, while the fool has many wants, ever thirsting for what is not there, longing to gratify his greedy and insatiable desire, which he fans into a blaze like a fire and brings both great and small within its reach.</s><s id="section9sent4">But the man of worth has few wants, standing midway between mortality and immortality.</s><s id="section9sent5">Some wants he has because his body is mortal, many he has not in virtue of his soul, which desires immortality.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">This is the way in which the wise</s><s id="section10sent2">pit riches against poverty.</s><s id="section10sent3">Against disrepute they pit good fame,</s><s id="section10sent4">for the praise which has its fountain head in noble conduct, flowing thence as from a perennial spring, has no currency among the unthinking masses, whose habit is to expose the inconstancies of their souls by random talk, often in order to purchase some shameful reward unblushingly directed against these men of choicest merit.</s><s id="section10sent5">But the number of these is small, for virtue is not widespread among mortal kind.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Again there</s><s id="section11sent2">is disablement of the senses.</s><s id="section11sent3">To live with this has</s><s id="section11sent4">been premature death to thousands, because they can find no medicine to protect them against its ills.</s><s id="section11sent5">Its opponent is wisdom, the best quality we have, which plants eyes in the mind, and the mind in keenness of vision excels the eyes of the body so that they, as people say, are a “mere nothing”</s><s id="section11sent6">in comparison.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">The body’s eyes observe the surfaces of things visible</s><s id="section12sent2">and need the external help of light, but the mind penetrates through the depth of material things, accurately observing their whole contents and their several parts, surveying also the nature of things immaterial, which sense is unable to descry.</s><s id="section12sent3">For we may say that it achieves all the keenness of vision, which an eye can have, without needing any adventitious light, itself a star and, we may say, a copy and likeness of the heavenly company.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Again</s><s id="section13sent2">diseases of the body, if the soul is healthy, do very little harm.</s><s id="section13sent3">And the health of the soul is to have its faculties, reason, high spirit and desire happily tempered, with the reason in command and reining in both the other two, like restive horses.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">The</s><s id="section14sent2">special name of this health is temperance, that is σωφροσύνη or “thought-preserving,”</s><s id="section14sent3">for it creates a preservation of one of our powers, namely, that of wise-thinking.</s><s id="section14sent4">For often when that power is in danger of being submerged by the tide of the passions, this spiritual health prevents it from being lost in the depths and pulls it up and lifts it on high, vitalizing and quickening it, and giving it a kind of immortality.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">All the above are lessons and instructions, which</s><s id="section15sent2">stand recorded in many places of the law, urging the tractable in gentle, the intractable in sterner terms to despise the bodily and external goods, holding the life of virtue to be the one sole end and pursuing after everything else that is conducive to it.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">And if I</s><s id="section16sent2">had not in my earlier writings dealt fully with each of the rules which promote simplicity, I would attempt to dilate on them at this point, and embrace in a collected list the scattered precepts which appear in different places.</s><s id="section16sent3">But as I have said all that occasion required, I think it better not to repeat myself.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">Still those who do not shrink from the task but are</s><s id="section17sent2">at pains to study the books which precede these, ought to perceive that practically everything there said about simplicity</s><s id="section17sent3">includes the thought of courage, since it is the mark of a soul, vigorous, gallant and full of mettle, that it despises everything which vanity is wont to glorify to the destruction of life in any true sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">So earnestly and carefully does the law desire</s><s id="section18sent2">to train and exercise the soul to manly courage that it lays down rules even about the kind of garment which should be worn.</s><s id="section18sent3">It strictly forbids a man to assume a woman’s garb, in order that no trace, no merest shadow of the female, should attach to him to spoil his masculinity.</s><s id="section18sent4">For as it always follows nature, its will is to lay down rules suitable and consistent with each other, even down to the very smallest matters, whose commonplace nature seems to set them in the background.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">For since it saw as</s><s id="section19sent2">clearly, as if they were outlines on a flat surface,</s><s id="section19sent3">how unlike the bodily shapes of man and woman are, and that each of the two has a different life assigned to it, to the one a domestic, to the other a civic life, it judged it well in other matters too to prescribe rules all of which though not directly made by nature were the outcome of wise reflection and in accordance with nature.</s><s id="section19sent4">These were such as dealt with habits of life and dress and any similar matters.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">It considered that in such matters the true</s><s id="section20sent2">man should maintain his masculinity, particularly in his clothes, which as he always wears them by day and night ought to have nothing to suggest unmanliness.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">In the same way he trained the woman to</s><s id="section21sent2">decency of adornment and forbade her to assume the dress of a man, with the further object of guarding against the mannish-woman as much as the womanish-man.</s><s id="section21sent3">He knew that as in buildings, if one of the foundation stones is removed, the rest will not remain as they were.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">To proceed, since the time in which human</s><s id="section22sent2">events occur may be divided into war-time and peacetime, we may observe the place taken by the virtues in both.</s><s id="section22sent3">In regard to the others this has been discussed already</s><s id="section22sent4">and will be again if need arise, but courage at this point calls for a close examination.</s><s id="section22sent5">The effects it produces in peace are extolled by him in many places of the law book, and he is always ready to seize opportunity for so doing.</s><s id="section22sent6">These have been</s><s id="section22sent7">noted in their proper places</s><s id="section22sent8">and we will now begin to describe its feats in war.</s><s id="section22sent9">One prefatory remark, however, must be made.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">He considers that in drawing</s><s id="section23sent2">up the roll of soldiers, the summons should not include all those of military age, but he would have some excluded, reasonable excuses being added for their exemption from service.</s><s id="section23sent3">These are in the first instance the cravens and cowards who are sure to be the victims of their ingrained feebleness and create fear in the other combatants.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">For the evil</s><s id="section24sent2">in one man is often well reproduced</s><s id="section24sent3">in his neighbour, particularly in war, where trepidation</s><s id="section24sent4">has confused the reasoning faculty and rendered it incapable of nicely estimating facts.</s><s id="section24sent5">People are then accustomed to call cowardice caution and timidity foresight and unmanliness safety-seeking, and so invest the basest actions with grand and fair-sounding titles.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">And,</s><s id="section25sent2">therefore, unwilling that his own cause should be injured by the cowardice of those who are to take the field and that of the enemy glorified by an easy victory over a contemptible</s><s id="section25sent3">body of degenerates and knowing that a crowd of idlers is no help but an impediment to success, he excludes the timid and faint-hearted cowards on the same principle, I think, that a general does not enforce war-service on persons</s><s id="section25sent4">who are diseased in body and are, therefore, excused by their infirmity.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">But cowardice, too, is a disease,</s><s id="section26sent2">graver than any that affects the body since it destroys the faculties of the soul.</s><s id="section26sent3">Diseases of the body flourish but for a short time, but cowardice is an inbred evil, as closely inherent or more so than any part of the bodily system from the earliest years to extreme old age, unless it is healed by God.</s><s id="section26sent4">For all things are possible to Him.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">Furthermore, he does not even enlist all the most</s><s id="section27sent2">courageous, be they ever so robust both in body and soul, and willing to fight and face danger in the forefront.</s><s id="section27sent3">While</s><s id="section27sent4">He praises them for their resolution and for the public-spirited, zealous and undaunted temper which they show, he carefully inquires whether they are in bondage to any cogent considerations, whose force leads them where it will.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">If, he says, a man has</s><s id="section28sent2">lately built a house, but has not yet had time to occupy it, or just planted a vineyard, setting the shoots in the ground with his own hand, and yet has had no opportunity to enjoy the fruits, or has betrothed himself to a maiden, but has not married her, he is to be exempted from all war service, and so gain security through the humaneness of the law.</s><s id="section28sent3">And this for</s><s id="section28sent4">two reasons.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">One is that, since the issues of war</s><s id="section29sent2">are uncertain, others should not take without toil or trouble the property of those who have laboured to get it.</s><s id="section29sent3">For it seems cruel that a man should not be able to enjoy his own, and that one should build a house and another live in it, or should plant a vineyard and another who did not plant it should reap the fruit, or should pledge himself to a maiden and another not so pledged should marry her, and, therefore, it was not right to render futile the hopes of those who expected to find themselves living under happy conditions.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Another object was that when</s><s id="section30sent2">their bodies were fighting their souls should not play the laggard.</s><s id="section30sent3">In such circumstances, their minds must needs be feeling the strain of yearning for the joys from which they have been torn.</s><s id="section30sent4">Just as hungry or thirsty people, when some food or drink presents itself, race in pursuit of it without a backward glance in their eagerness to partake of it, so those who have laboured to gain a lawful wife or a house or a farm, and hopefully think that a time for using it is on the point of arriving, are distressed when they are robbed of its enjoyment, and thus though present in the body, are absent in the better part, the soul,</s><s id="section30sent5">which is the determining factor of success or failure.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">So</s><s id="section31sent2">then he did not think that the military enlistment should include these or others like them, but rather persons into whom no passion has found an entry and there made its home, in order that with free and unfettered alacrity they might gird themselves to</s><s id="section31sent3">face danger without evasion.</s><s id="section31sent4">For just as a body which suffers from sickness or injuries has no use for a full suit of armour and will discard it as beyond its feeble strength, so a robust body will be ruined if the soul is afflicted with a passion which does not accord with the task before it.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">With these</s><s id="section32sent2">considerations before him he selects not only his captains and generals, and other officers, but also each soldier, by testing him to see how far his body is in good condition, and his thinking sound.</s><s id="section32sent3">Of the body he inquires if it is without defect, healthy through and through, with all its parts and limbs well adjusted for the postures and movements required of each: of the soul, whether it is charged with valour and enterprise, whether it is proof against panic and full of generous sagacity, whether it cherishes honour and prefers death with renown to inglorious life?</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Each of these qualities separately in itself is in very</s><s id="section33sent2">truth a power; if they all meet and combine, those who possess them will display a strength sufficient and more than sufficient to defy all combatants and opponents, and will win a bloodless victory over their enemies.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">A very clear proof of these statements is</s><s id="section34sent2">included in the sacred books.</s><s id="section34sent3">The Arabians, whose name in old times was Midianites, are a very populous nation.</s><s id="section34sent4">They were disposed to be hostile to the Hebrews, the main reason being the reverence and honour which that people, dedicated to the Maker and Father of all, pays to the supreme and primal Cause.</s><s id="section34sent5">Accordingly they contrived all possible devices and made all possible attempts</s><s id="section34sent6">to turn them away from honouring the One, the truly Existent, and to change their religion to impiety.</s><s id="section34sent7">For if they succeeded in this, they thought they would make an easy conquest.</s><s id="section34sent8">But when after countless efforts of word and deed they were utterly exhausted, like men in peril of death,</s><s id="section34sent9">where there is no hope of salvation, they as a last resource devised a scheme of the following kind.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">They sent for the most</s><s id="section35sent2">exquisitely beautiful among their women and said to them, “You see how unlimited is the number of the Hebrews, but their number is not so dangerous and menacing a weapon as their unanimity and mutual attachment.</s><s id="section35sent3">And the highest and greatest source of this unanimity is their creed of a single God, through which, as from a fountain, they feel a love for each other, uniting them in an indissoluble bond.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Now man is easily led captive by pleasure, and particularly</s><s id="section36sent2">by the pleasure of intercourse with women.</s><s id="section36sent3">You are exceedingly comely; beauty is naturally seductive, and youth easily lapses into incontinence.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">Do not fear the names of harlotry or adultery as</s><s id="section37sent2">likely to bring disgrace, but set against them the benefits arising from your action—benefits which will enable you to convert the transient disrepute into a renown which knows no old age or death.</s><s id="section37sent3">For though in outward appearance you prostitute your bodies, to outwit and out-general our enemies, you will keep your souls virgin, and crown them with a chastity which will last into the future.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">And this</s><s id="section38sent2">war will have a glory without precedent in that it was brought to a successful conclusion by women and not by men, for it is our sex, we confess, which will suffer defeat, because our opponents are more distinguished in all warlike qualities, while yours will be completely victorious, and in addition to victory will have also the high excellence that your exploits have entailed no dangers.</s><s id="section38sent3">For you have merely to be seen, and at that first appearance, without bloodshed or rather without an effort, the day will be yours.”</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">When they heard these words, the women, who had</s><s id="section39sent2">never dreamt of such a thing as purity of life, nor had a taste of sound education, gave their consent.</s><s id="section39sent3">For their hitherto assumed modesty of character was mere hypocrisy.</s><s id="section39sent4">They decked themselves with costly garments and necklaces, and with everything else with which women are accustomed to bedizen themselves and took great pains to make their natural beauty still more comely.</s><s id="section39sent5">For the prize they aimed</s><s id="section39sent6">at was of no small magnitude, the capture of the youths who had hitherto been uncaptured.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">They</s><s id="section40sent2">then openly presented themselves, and when they were near at hand, with meretricious glances and wheedling talk and lewd attitudes and movements, they set their bait before the weaker-minded part of the younger men, whose character had no ballast or stability.</s><s id="section40sent3">And when by the shameful use of their bodies they had got the souls of their lovers on their hook, they summoned them to join in offering to the works of men’s hands, sacrifices which were no sacrifices, and libations which brought no peace.</s><s id="section40sent4">Thus they estranged them from the service of the One, the truly existing God, and having effected this, reported the good news to the men.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">And they would have</s><s id="section41sent2">enticed others also of the less stable kind had not God the beneficent and merciful, taking pity for their sad condition, lost no time in punishing the mad folly of the offenders, 24,000</s><s id="section41sent3">in number, and restrained those who were like to be overwhelmed as by a torrent, but were brought by Him to their senses through fear.</s></p></div>
