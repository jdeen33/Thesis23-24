That the Worse is Wont to Attack the Better
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us make our way to the plain.</s><s id="section1sent2">And it came to pass when they were on the plain that Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him” (Gen. iv. 8).</s><s id="section1sent3">What Cain is aiming at is by means of a challenge to draw Abel into a dispute, and to gain the mastery over him by plausible sophistries that have the appearance of truth.</s><s id="section1sent4">For, drawing our conclusions about things that are obscure from things that are manifest, we say that the plain, the rendezvous to which he summons him, is a figure of contest and desperate battle.</s><s id="section1sent5">For we see that most contests both in war and peace take place on plains.</s><s id="section1sent6">In peace those who contend in athletic sports look out for race-courses and spacious plains; and in war it is not usual to fight infantry or cavalry battles on hills; for the casualties arising from the unfavourable nature of the ground would outnumber those inflicted on each other by the combatants.</s><s id="section1sent7">Here is a signal proof of this.</s><s id="section1sent8">The earnest seeker of knowledge, at war with ignorance, the contrary condition, when shepherding (so to speak) with admonition and correction the irrational powers in the soul, is presented to us on a plain: for “Jacob sent and called Leah</s><s id="section1sent9">and Rachel to the plain, where the flocks were”
(Gen. xxxi. 4), making it clear that the plain is a figure for contentiousness.</s><s id="section1sent10">And what is his motive for calling them?</s><s id="section1sent11">“I see your father’s face,” he said, “that it is not toward me as it used to be: but the God of my father has been with me” (Gen. xxxi. 5). ‘The reason,’ I should be inclined to say, ‘that Laban is not on thy side, is that God is with thee; for in a soul in which the outward object of sense is valued as a supreme good, in that soul excellent reason is not found: but in one in which God walks, the outward object of sense is not regarded as a good thing: and it is to this that the conception and name of Laban corresponds.’</s><s id="section1sent12">And such men as order themselves by the principle of gradual progress in accordance with their father’s rule, have chosen the plain as a suitable place for their task of teaching the soul’s irrational impulses a better way.</s><s id="section1sent13">For the words addressed to Joseph are: “Do not thy brethren tend their flocks in Sychem?</s><s id="section1sent14">Come let me send thee to them.”</s><s id="section1sent15">And he said “Here am ”
And he said to him “Go see, whether thy brethren are in good health and the sheep, and bring me word.”</s><s id="section1sent16">And he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Sychem.</s><s id="section1sent17">And a man found him wandering in the plain: and the man asked him
“What seekest thou?”</s><s id="section1sent18">And he said “I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed their flocks.”</s><s id="section1sent19">And the man said to him “They have departed hence, for I heard them saying’</s><s id="section1sent20">Let us go to Dothaim.’ ” (Gen. xxxvii. 13–17).</s><s id="section1sent21">It is evident from these words that they are in the plain, caring for the irrational powers within them.</s><s id="section1sent22">And, because he is unable to bear the too great severity</s><s id="section1sent23">of his father’s knowledge, Joseph is sent to them, that in the hands of more lenient instructors he may learn what he ought to do and what will be beneficial; for the creed he has hitherto followed is one woven of incongruous elements, multifarious and complex in the highest degree.</s><s id="section1sent24">This is why the lawgiver says that a coat of many colours was made for him (Gen. xxxvii.</s><s id="section1sent25">3), indicating by this that he is the promulgator of a doctrine full of mazes and hard to disentangle.</s><s id="section1sent26">He is one who moulds his theories with an eye to statecraft rather than to truth.</s><s id="section1sent27">This appears in his treatment of the three kinds of good things,</s><s id="section1sent28">those pertaining to the outside world, to the body, and to the soul.</s><s id="section1sent29">These, though separated from each other by complete diversity of nature, he brings together and combines into one, claiming to show that each is in need of each and all of all, and that the aggregate resulting from taking them all together in a body is a perfect and really complete good; but that the constituents out of which this is compacted, though indeed parts or elements of good things, are not good things in perfection.</s><s id="section1sent30">He points out that neither fire nor earth nor any of the four elements, out of which the universe was formed, is a world, but the coming together and blending of the elements into one; and argues that in precisely the same way happiness is found to be neither a peculiar property of the things of the outside world, nor of the things pertaining to the body, nor of those pertaining to the soul, taken by themselves.</s><s id="section1sent31">He argues that each of the three classes mentioned has the character of a part or element and that it is only when they are all taken together in the aggregate that they produce happiness.</s><s id="section1sent32">In order, then, that he</s><s id="section1sent33">may be taught better ideas than these, he is sent to men who hold that nothing is a good thing</s><s id="section1sent34">but what has true beauty, and that this is a property belonging to the soul as soul; men who are convinced that advantages pertaining to things outside and to the body are good things in name only, not in reality.</s><s id="section1sent35">For it says “Behold thy brethren tend their flocks,” and govern every irrational element of their being “in Sychem” (Gen. xxxvii. 13).</s><s id="section1sent36">“Sychem” means “shoulder,” a symbol of patient toil; for lovers of virtue carry a very great burden, namely resistance to the body and bodily pleasure, and in addition to these resistance to external things and the delights which they afford us.</s><s id="section1sent37">“Come then let me send thee to them,” (ibid.), that is, ‘submit to be summoned elsewhere, and draw nigh and entertain in thine understanding a ready eagerness for the receiving of better teaching.</s><s id="section1sent38">Up to the present time thou deludest thyself with the idea that thou hast welcomed the true education.</s><s id="section1sent39">For thou professest to be ready to be taught otherwise, though thou hast not yet in thine own heart acknowledged thy need of this.</s><s id="section1sent40">Thy cry “Here am I” seems to me to convict thee of rash and reckless compliance, rather than to indicate readiness to learn.</s><s id="section1sent41">A proof of this is that soon afterwards the real man will find thee wandering in the way (Gen. xxxvii. 15), whereas thou never wouldst have lost the way hadst thou with a healthy resolve come to be trained.</s><s id="section1sent42">And mark, the words in which thy father urges thee to go put no compulsion on thee, in order that thou mayest follow the better course at thine own prompting and by thine own spontaneous action.</s><s id="section1sent43">His words are: “Go see,” contemplate and observe and</s><s id="section1sent44">with perfect exactness consider the matter; for thou must first know that at which thou art about to labour, and then afterwards proceed to attend to it.</s><s id="section1sent45">When however thou hast surveyed it and with comprehensive glance obtained a complete view of it in all its parts, go on further to examine those who have already applied themselves to it and become its devotees.</s><s id="section1sent46">Thou must find out whether in pursuing this course they are of sound mind,</s><s id="section1sent47">and not mad, as those who love pleasure imagine in their mocking depreciation of them.</s><s id="section1sent48">Consider the matter, I say, and judge whether they be sane who practise this discipline; and yet let not thy judgement be final till thou hast brought word and made a report to thy father; for the judgements of those who are beginning to learn are unsettled and unstable, while in those who have made much progress they are firmly fixed; and the only way is for the others to acquire stedfastness from these.’</s><s id="section1sent49">If, Ο my understanding, thou searchest on this wise into the oracles which are both words of God and laws given by men whom God loves, thou shalt not be compelled to admit anything base or unworthy of their dignity.</s><s id="section1sent50">Why, how could any sensible person admit the very narrative of which we are now speaking?</s><s id="section1sent51">Is it likely that Jacob, who had the wealth of a king, was so badly off for household servants or attendants as to send a son out abroad to bring word about his other children, whether they are in good health, and about the cattle to boot?</s><s id="section1sent52">His grandfather, apart from the multitude of prisoners of war whom he carried off after defeating nine kings, had over three hundred home-bred servants; and since then there has been no curtailing of his menage,</s><s id="section1sent53">but as time went on it has in every way grown greater.</s><s id="section1sent54">Having then an abundant supply of servants he would never have thought fit to send a son, of whom he was specially fond, on a business which could easily have been carried out quite well even by one of the least valuable of his dependents.</s><s id="section1sent55">Now you notice that Scripture goes out of its way to record even the place from which he dispatches him, all but giving the reader a plain hint to avoid the literal interpretation.</s><s id="section1sent56">For it says “out of the vale of Hebron” (Gen. xxxvii. 14).</s><s id="section1sent57">Now “Hebron,” a “coupling” and “comradeship,” is a figurative title for our body, because it is “coupled” with a soul, and has established a friendship and “comradeship” with it.</s><s id="section1sent58">As “vales” it has organs of sense, great receivers of all objects of sense outside it.</s><s id="section1sent59">These pump over the understanding the countless qualities of things, and pour them in upon it through the receivers, flooding it and totally submerging it.</s><s id="section1sent60">This is why in the Law of Leprosy, when greenish or reddish depressions show themselves in a house, an injunction is given to remove the stones in which they have appeared and to put others in their place (Lev. xiv. 57 if,).</s><s id="section1sent61">That is to say, when diverse qualities, the handiwork of pleasures and desires and passions akin to these, press and weigh down the whole soul, hollowing it out and lowering its level, we are to get rid of the principles which cause the infirmity, and introduce in their place good healthy principles by means of a training under the law or indeed of a good education.</s><s id="section1sent62">Seeing, therefore, that Joseph has utterly sunk into the hollows of the body and the senses,</s><s id="section1sent63">he challenges him to quit his lurking-place and go forward and draw a free draught of the spirit of stedfastness by resorting to those who were once aspirants after it, and are now teachers of it.</s><s id="section1sent64">But he, though he fancied that he had made a move forward, is found wandering: for he says, “a man found him wandering in the plain” (Gen. xxxvii. 15), showing that toil by itself is not good, but toil accompanied by skill.</s><s id="section1sent65">For just as it is our business not to practise music unmusically or grammar ungrammatically, or, to say it in a word, any art without art or with bad art, but to practise each art in the way which that art requires, so neither is it our business to practise good sense with cunning, or self-mastery with stinginess and meanness, or courage with rashness, or piety in a superstitious way, or any other virtue-governed knowledge in a spirit of ignorance;</s><s id="section1sent66">for everyone knows that these are trackless regions.</s><s id="section1sent67">Accordingly there is a law bidding us
“follow what is just in a just way” (Deut. xvi. 20), that we pursue justice and all virtue by doing the deeds akin to it, but not those that are contrary to it.</s><s id="section1sent68">If then thou observest anyone not taking food or drink when he should, or refusing to use the bath and oil, or careless about his clothing, or sleeping on the ground, and occupying wretched lodgings, and then on the strength of all this fancying that he is practising self-control, take pity on his mistake, and show him the true method of self-control; for all these practices of his are fruitless and wearisome labours, prostrating soul and body by starving and in other ways maltreating them.</s><s id="section1sent69">A man may submit</s><s id="section1sent70">to sprinklings with holy water and to purifications, befouling his understanding while cleansing his body; he may, having more money than he knows what to do with, found a temple, providing all its furniture on a scale of lavish magnificence; he may offer up hecatombs, and never cease sacrificing bullocks; he may adorn the sacred building with costly votive offerings, employing on them rich material in abundance, and skilled craftsmanship that is more priceless than silver and gold; yet shall he not be inscribed on the roll of the pious.</s><s id="section1sent71">No, for this man, like those others, has gone astray from the road that accords with piety, deeming it to be ritual instead of holiness, and offering gifts to Him who cannot be bribed and will not accept such things, and flattering Him who cannot be flattered, who welcomes genuine worship of every kind, but abhors all counterfeit approaches.</s><s id="section1sent72">Genuine worship is that of a soul bringing simple reality as its only sacrifice; all that is mere display, fed by lavish expenditure on externals, is counterfeit.</s><s id="section1sent73">Some say that the proper name of the man who found him wandering on the plain has not been mentioned (Gen. xxxvii. 15).</s><s id="section1sent74">Those who say so are themselves, too, in some sort astray, owing to their inability to see clearly the right way in matters generally.</s><s id="section1sent75">For had they not been smitten with partial blindness of the soul’s eye, they would have recognized that the name which most correctly describes the real man and most thoroughly belongs to him is simply “man,” the most proper title of a mind endowed with reason and articulate utterance.</s><s id="section1sent76">This “man,” dwelling in the soul of each of us, is discovered at one time as king and governor, at another as judge and umpire of life’s contests.</s><s id="section1sent77">Sometimes he assumes the part of witness or accuser, and, all unseen, convicts us from within, not allowing us so much as to open our mouth, but, holding in and curbing the tongue with the reins of conscience, checks its wilful and rebellious course.</s><s id="section1sent78">This challenger</s><s id="section1sent79">inquired of the soul when he saw it wandering, “What seekest thou?” (Gen. xxxvii. 15).’</s><s id="section1sent80">Is it sound sense thou art seeking?</s><s id="section1sent81">Why then dost thou walk upon the path of cunning?</s><s id="section1sent82">Is it self-mastery?</s><s id="section1sent83">But this road leads to stinginess.</s><s id="section1sent84">Is it courage?</s><s id="section1sent85">Rashness meets thee by this way.</s><s id="section1sent86">Is it piety thou art in quest of?</s><s id="section1sent87">This road is that of superstition.’</s><s id="section1sent88">But if it says that it is seeking the principles of science and longs after them as its brethren nearest of kin, let us not believe it at all; for its inquiry would not have been “where do they feed” (ibid. v. 16), but “where do they tend” their flocks?</s><s id="section1sent89">For those who feed us supply nourishment in the shape of all objects of sense to the irrational and insatiable flock of the senses, nourishment which robs us of self-control and plunges us in misery; whereas those who tend, having the power of rulers and governors, tame what has become wild by repressing the vehemence of the desires.</s><s id="section1sent90">Had the soul, then, been seeking the real devotees of virtue, it would have looked for them among kings, not among cup-bearers or confectioners or cooks; for whereas these prepare the things that minister to pleasures, those rule over pleasures.</s><s id="section1sent91">So it is a right answer that the man gives who has seen the deceit: “they have departed hence” (Gen. xxxvii. 17).</s><s id="section1sent92">He points to the material frame, showing that all who maintain a toilsome contest for the winning</s><s id="section1sent93">of virtue quit the earthly region and are resolved to mount the skies, carrying in their train no bodily disabilities.</s><s id="section1sent94">For the man says that he also heard them saying, “Let us go to Dothaim” (ibid.).</s><s id="section1sent95">Now
“Dothaim” means “thorough quitting.”</s><s id="section1sent96">So their words are a guarantee that, not in any half-and-half way but out-and-out, have they set themselves to study how to forsake and quit all that does not contribute to virtue.</s><s id="section1sent97">In like manner we read,
“Sarah was quit of her experience of what belongs to women” (Gen. xviii. 11); and the passions are by nature feminine, and we must practise the quitting of these for the masculine traits that mark the noble affections.</s><s id="section1sent98">Well, then, it is on a plain, that is, amid a contest of words, that Joseph is found wandering, the advocate of a subtle form of doctrine serving to inculcate statecraft rather than truth.</s><s id="section1sent99">Among those who contend in the sports there are some whose bodies are in such splendid condition that their opponents withdraw from the contest, and they are crowned without having to fight, winning the prize on the score of their incomparable strength, without so much as having had themselves sprinkled with dust in preparation for the combat.</s><s id="section1sent100">Endowed in mind, the divinest part of us.</s><s id="section1sent101">with a strength such as that of these athletes, Isaac “goeth out into the plain” (Gen. xxiv. 63), not to contend with anyone, for those who would oppose him have cowered before the greatness of his nature, so far beyond them in all ways.</s><s id="section1sent102">No, he goes forth desiring only to be alone with God, the Guide and Fellow-traveller of his path and of his soul, and to have converse with Him.</s><s id="section1sent103">We have a very plain proof that it was no mortal talking</s><s id="section1sent104">to Isaac.</s><s id="section1sent105">For Rebecca, who is persistence, will presently inquire of the servant as seeing one and receiving an impression of one only, “Who is this man who is coming to meet us?</s><s id="section1sent106">“(ibid. v. 65).</s><s id="section1sent107">For the soul that persists in noble courses is indeed capable of apprehending self-taught wisdom, which is represented by the title “Isaac,” but is unable as yet to see God the Ruler of wisdom.</s><s id="section1sent108">In keeping with this the servant, confirming her inability to apprehend Him who is unseen and who is invisibly conversing with him, says, “this is my master”
(ibid.), pointing at Isaac only; for it is not likely that if two had been visible he would have pointed at one.</s><s id="section1sent109">No, he did not see Him who cannot be pointed at, for He is invisible to all who are but midway on their course.</s><s id="section1sent110">Well, I think it has been made sufficiently clear that the plain on to which Cain challenges Abel to come is a figure of a contest to be fought out.</s><s id="section1sent111">We must next endeavour to discover what the subjects of their investigations are when they have gone forth.</s><s id="section1sent112">It is evident that they are to investigate opposing views clean contrary to each other.</s><s id="section1sent113">For Abel, referring all things to God, is a God-loving creed; but Cain, referring all to himself—his name means
“acquisition”—a self-loving creed.</s><s id="section1sent114">And lovers of self, when they have stripped and prepared for conflict with those who value virtue, keep up the boxing and wrestling</s><s id="section1sent115">until they have either forced their opponents to give in, or have completely destroyed them.</s><s id="section1sent116">For they leave no stone unturned, as the saying is, while they ply their questions.</s><s id="section1sent117">’</s><s id="section1sent118">Is not the body the soul’s house?’</s><s id="section1sent119">Why, then, should we not take care of a house, that it may not</s><s id="section1sent120">fall into ruins?</s><s id="section1sent121">Are not eyes and ears and the band of the other senses bodyguards and courtiers, as it were, of the soul?</s><s id="section1sent122">Must we not then value allies and friends equally with ourselves?</s><s id="section1sent123">Did nature create pleasures and enjoyments and the delights that meet us all the way through life, for the dead, or for those who have never come into existence, and not for the living?</s><s id="section1sent124">And what is to induce us to forgo the acquisition of wealth and fame and honours and offices and everything else of that sort, things which secure for us a life not merely of safety but of happiness?</s><s id="section1sent125">The mode of life of these two classes is a witness to the truth of what I say.</s><s id="section1sent126">The so-called lovers of virtue are almost without exception obscure people, looked down upon, of mean estate, destitute of the necessaries of life, not enjoying the privileges of subject peoples or even of slaves, filthy, sallow, reduced to skeletons, with a hungry look from want of food, the prey of disease, in training for dying.</s><s id="section1sent127">Those, on the other hand, who take care of themselves are men of mark and wealth, holding leading positions, praised on all hands, recipients of honours, portly, healthy and robust, revelling in luxurious and riotous living, knowing nothing of labour, conversant with pleasures which carry the sweets of life to the all-welcoming soul by every channel of sense.</s><s id="section1sent128">When they have covered the dreary length of a long-distance course of talk like this, they are held to have defeated men unaccustomed to quibbling arguments.</s><s id="section1sent129">But their victory lies not in the strength of those who have won, but in their opponents’ weakness at this sort of thing.</s><s id="section1sent130">For those who apply themselves to the pursuit of virtue may be placed in</s><s id="section1sent131">two classes.</s><s id="section1sent132">Some, making the soul alone the treasure-house of the good at which they aim, devote themselves to praiseworthy actions, without having so much as dreamt of jugglery with words.</s><s id="section1sent133">The others are doubly successful; their mind is secured by wisdom in counsel and good deeds, their speech by the arts of eloquence.</s><s id="section1sent134">Now to encounter the wranglings in which some folk delight is eminently fitting for these latter, ready and equipped as they are with the means of withstanding their enemies, but for the former class it is not at all safe to do so.</s><s id="section1sent135">For who are there that unarmed could meet armed men, and fight them on equal terms, seeing that, even were they fully equipped, the combat would be an unequal one?</s><s id="section1sent136">Now Abel has never learned arts of speech, and knows the beautiful and noble with his mind only.</s><s id="section1sent137">For this reason he should have declined the meeting on the plain, and have paid no regard to the challenge of the man of ill-will: for any shrinking back is better than defeat, and such shrinking back as this, though our enemies call it cowardice, is called caution by our friends; and since they are free from falsehood, we should believe friends in preference to men who have ill-will towards us.</s><s id="section1sent138">Do you not see that Moses fights shy of the sophists in “Egypt,” that is, in the body?</s><s id="section1sent139">He calls them “magicians,” because good morals are spoiled by the tricks and deceptions of sophistry acting on them like the enchantments of magic.</s><s id="section1sent140">Moses* plea is that he is not “eloquent “(Exod. iv. 10), which is equivalent to saying that he has no gift for the oratory which is but specious guesswork at what seems probable.</s><s id="section1sent141">Afterwards he follows this up by emphatically stating that he is not merely</s><s id="section1sent142">not eloquent but absolutely “speechless” (Exod. vi. 12).</s><s id="section1sent143">He calls himself “speechless,” not in the sense in which we use the word of animals without reason, but of him who fails to find a fitting instrument in the language uttered by the organs of speech, and prints and impresses on his understanding the lessons of true wisdom, the direct opposite of false sophistry.</s><s id="section1sent144">And he will not go to Egypt nor engage in conflict with its sophists, until he has been fully trained in the word of utterance, God having shown and perfected all the qualities</s><s id="section1sent145">which are essential to expression of thought by the election of Aaron who is Moses’ brother, and of whom he is wont to speak as his “mouth” and “spokesman”
and “prophet “(Exod. iv. 16; vii. 1); for all these titles belong to Speech or Word, which is brother of Mind.</s><s id="section1sent146">For mind is the fountain of words and speech is its outlet.</s><s id="section1sent147">For all the thoughts of the heart, like streams from a spring, well up and flow forth into the open through speech;
