Who is the Heir of Divine Things
and on the division into equals and opposites
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">In the preceding treatise</s><s id="section1sent2">we have discussed as</s><s id="section1sent3">carefully as was possible the question of rewards.</s><s id="section1sent4">Now our task is to inquire who is the heir of divine things.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">When the Sage heard the oracular promise to this purport, “Thy reward shall be exceeding great,”</s><s id="section2sent2">he answers with the question, “Master, what wilt thou give me?</s><s id="section2sent3">I go hence childless.</s><s id="section2sent4">The son of Masek, she who was born in my house, is this Damascus Eliezer.”</s><s id="section2sent5">And again he says “Since thou hast given me no seed, he that was born in my house shall be my heir” (Gen. xv.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">1–3).</s><s id="section3sent2">Yet we</s><s id="section3sent3">should have expected that he (for who would not?) would have been struck mute and speechless in amazement at the majesty and greatness of the Giver of the oracle, if not for fear, at any rate for exceeding joy.</s><s id="section3sent4">For men are tongue-tied by overwhelming joy, as well as by violent grief.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">This it is that led Moses</s><s id="section4sent2">to confess that he has become feeble of voice and slow of tongue, ever since God began to hold converse with him (Ex. iv. 10).</s><s id="section4sent3">And the testimony of the prophet is true indeed.</s><s id="section4sent4">For at such times it is natural that</s><s id="section4sent5">the organ of speech should be held in check, while the language of the understanding becomes articulate and flows in resistless stream, as its wisdom pours forth beauty after beauty, not of words but of thoughts, with a power as easy as it is sublime.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Yet courage</s><s id="section5sent2">and well-timed frankness before our superiors are admirable virtues also, so that there seems to be more truth than comedy in the words of the comic poet,</s><s id="section5sent3">The servant, trained to keep a quiet tongue
Whate’er befalls, is sure to prove a knave.</s><s id="section5sent4">Grant to thy man some measure of free speech.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">When, then, is it that the servant</s><s id="section6sent2">speaks frankly to his master?</s><s id="section6sent3">Surely it is when his heart tells him that he has not wronged his owner, but that his words and deeds are all for that owner’s benefit.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">And so when else should the slave of God</s><s id="section7sent2">open his mouth freely to Him Who is the ruler and master both of himself and of the All, save when he is pure from sin and the judgements of his conscience are loyal to his master, when he feels more joy at being the servant of God than if he had been king of all the human race and assumed an uncontested sovereignty over land and sea alike?</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">The loyalty of</s><s id="section8sent2">Abraham’s service and ministry is shewn by the concluding words of the oracle addressed to Abraham’s son, “I will give to thee and thy seed all this land, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in thy seed, because Abraham thy father hearkened to My voice and kept My injunctions, My commands, My ordinances and My statutes” (Gen. xxvi.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">3–5).</s><s id="section9sent2">It is</s><s id="section9sent3">the highest praise which can be given to a servant, that he neglects none of his master’s commands, that never hesitating in his labour of love he employs all</s><s id="section9sent4">and more than all his powers as he strives by sound judgement to bring all his business to a successful issue.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">There are indeed some whom it</s><s id="section10sent2">befits to hear but not to speak, those to whom the words apply, “Be silent and hear” (Deut. xxvii. 9). An excellent injunction!</s><s id="section10sent3">For ignorance is exceeding bold and glib of tongue; and the first remedy for it is to hold its peace, the second to give ear to those who advance something worth hearing.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Yet let no one</s><s id="section11sent2">suppose that this exhausts the significance of the words “be silent and hear.”</s><s id="section11sent3">No, they enjoin something else of greater weight.</s><s id="section11sent4">They bid us not only be silent with the tongue and hear with the ears, but be silent and hear with the soul also.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">For many</s><s id="section12sent2">who come to hear a discourse have not come with their minds, but wander abroad rehearsing inwardly numberless thoughts on numberless subjects, thoughts on their families, on outsiders, on things private and things public, which properly should be forgotten for the moment.</s><s id="section12sent3">All these, we may say,</s><s id="section12sent4">form a series of successions in the mind, and the inward uproar makes it impossible for them to listen to the speaker, who discourses as in an audience not of human beings, but of lifeless statues who have ears, but no hearing is in those ears.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">|</s><s id="section13sent2">If then the mind determines</s><s id="section13sent3">to have no dealing with any of the matters which visit it from abroad or are stored within it, but maintaining peace and tranquillity addresses itself to hear the speaker, it will be “silent,” as Moses commands, and thus be able to listen with complete attention.</s><s id="section13sent4">Otherwise it will have no such power.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">For the ignorant then it is well to</s><s id="section14sent2">keep silence, but for those who desire knowledge and also love their master, frank speech is a most essential possession.</s><s id="section14sent3">Thus we read in Exodus, “The Lord will war for you and ye shall be silent,” and at once there follows a divine oracle in these words, “What is it that thou shoutest to me?”</s><s id="section14sent4">(Ex. xiv. 14, 15).</s><s id="section14sent5">The meaning is that those should keep silent who have nothing worth hearing to say, and those should speak who have put their faith in the God-sent love of wisdom, and not only speak with ordinary gentleness but shout with a louder cry.</s><s id="section14sent6">That cry is not made with mouth and tongue, through which, as we are told, the air assumes a spherical</s><s id="section14sent7">shape and thus is rendered perceptible by the sense of hearing, but by the organ of the soul, uniting all music in its mighty tones, heard by no mortal whatsoever, but only by Him Who is uncreated and imperishable.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">For the</s><s id="section15sent2">sweet and harmonious melody of the mind’s music can only be apprehended by the mind’s musician, not by any of those who are entangled in sense.</s><s id="section15sent3">But when the full organ of the understanding sounds forth its symphony of the single or double octave, the Hearer asks—asks we may call it, though He does not really ask, since all things are known to God—</s><s id="section15sent4">“What is it that thou criest so loud to me?”</s><s id="section15sent5">Is it in supplication for ills to be averted, or is in thanksgiving for blessings imparted, or in both?</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">And he that</s><s id="section16sent2">seemed to be feeble of speech and slow of tongue and wordless is found to be so loquacious, that in one place he is represented as not only speaking, but shouting, and in another as pouring forth a stream of words without cessation or pause.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">For “Moses,” we read,</s><s id="section17sent2">“was talking to God, and God was answering him</s><s id="section17sent3">with a voice” (Ex. xix. 19).</s><s id="section17sent4">We do not have the tense of completed action “he talked,” but the tense of prolonged and continuous action</s><s id="section17sent5">“he was talking”; and similarly God did not teach him (as a complete action) but was answering him always and uninterruptedly.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Now an answer always presupposes</s><s id="section18sent2">a question; and everyone asks what he does not know, because he thinks it good to learn and is aware that of all the steps which he can take to get knowledge, the most profitable is to seek, to ask questions, to think that he has no knowledge, and not to imagine that he has a firm apprehension of anything.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Now wise men take God for their guide and</s><s id="section19sent2">teacher, but the less perfect take the wise man; and therefore the Children of Israel say “Talk thou to us, and let not God talk to us lest we die” (Ex. xx. 19).</s><s id="section19sent3">But the man of worth has such courage of speech, that he is bold not only to speak and cry aloud, but actually to make an outcry of reproach, wrung from him by real conviction, and expressing true emotion.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Take the words “if Thou wilt forgive them their sin,</s><s id="section20sent2">forgive them; but if not, blot me out of the book which Thou hast written” (Ex. xxxii. 32); and “Did I conceive all this people in the womb, or did I bring them forth, because</s><s id="section20sent3">Thou sayest unto me, ‘take them to thy bosom, as a nurse lifts the suckling’?” (Num. xi. 12); or again “Whence shall I get flesh to give to this people, because they weep against me?</s><s id="section20sent4">Shall sheep and oxen be slaughtered, or all the meat that is in the sea be collected and suffice?” (Num. xi. 13, 22).</s><s id="section20sent5">Or “Lord, why hast Thou afflicted this people and why hast</s><s id="section20sent6">Thou sent me?</s><s id="section20sent7">And ever since I went to Pharoah to speak in Thy name, he has afflicted the people, and Thou hast not saved</s><s id="section20sent8">Thy people” (Ex. v. 22, 23).</s><s id="section20sent9">Anyone would have feared to say these or like words, even to one of the kings of particular kingdoms; yet he had the courage to utter these thoughts to God.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">He reached this</s><s id="section21sent2">limit, I will not say of daring in general but of good daring, because all the wise are friends of God, and particularly so in the judgement of the most holy lawgiver.</s><s id="section21sent3">Frankness of speech is akin to friendship.</s><s id="section21sent4">For to whom should a man speak with frankness but to his friend?</s><s id="section21sent5">And so most excellent is it, that in the oracles Moses is proclaimed the friend of God (Ex. xxxiii. 11), to shew that all the audacities of his bold discourse were uttered in friendship, rather than in presumption.</s><s id="section21sent6">For the audacity of rashness belongs to the presumptuous, the audacity of courage or confidence to a friend.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">But observe on the other hand that confidence</s><s id="section22sent2">is blended with caution.</s><s id="section22sent3">For while the words “What wilt thou give me” (Gen. xv. 2) shew confidence, “Master,” shews caution.</s><s id="section22sent4">While Moses usually employs two titles in speaking of the Cause, namely God and Lord, here he uses neither, but substitutes “Master.”</s><s id="section22sent5">In this he shews great caution and exactness in the use of terms.</s><s id="section22sent6">It is true that “Lord” and “Master” are said to be synonyms.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">But though one and the same thing is</s><s id="section23sent2">denoted by both, the connotations of the two titles are different.</s><s id="section23sent3">Κύριος (Lord) is derived from κῦρος (power) which is a thing secure and is the opposite of insecure and invalid (ἄκυρος) while δεσπότης (master) is from δεσμός (bond) from which I believe comes δέος (fear).</s><s id="section23sent4">Thus δεσπότης is a lord and something more, a terrible lord so to speak, one who is not only invested with the lordship and sovereignty of all things, but is also capable of inspiring fear and</s><s id="section23sent5">terror; perhaps too, since he is the bond of all things, one who holds them together indissolubly and binds them fast, when in themselves they are dissoluble.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">He who says, “Master, what wilt thou</s><s id="section24sent2">give me?” virtually says no less than this, “I am not ignorant of Thy transcendent sovereignty; I know the terrors of Thy power; I come before</s><s id="section24sent3">Thee in fear and trembling, and yet again I am confident.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">For</s><s id="section25sent2">Thou hast vouchsafed to bid me fear not;</s><s id="section25sent3">Thou</s><s id="section25sent4">hast given me a tongue of instruction that I should know when I should speak (Isaiah 1. 4),</s><s id="section25sent5">my mouth that was knitted up</s><s id="section25sent6">Thou hast unsewn, and when Thou hadst opened it, Thou didst strengthen its nerves for speech;</s><s id="section25sent7">Thou hast taught me to say what should be said, confirming the oracle ‘I will open thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt speak’ (Ex. iv.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">12).</s><s id="section26sent2">For who was I, that Thou shouldst impart speech to</s><s id="section26sent3">me, that Thou shouldst promise me something which stood higher in the scale of goods than ‘gift’ or grace, even a ‘reward’.</s><s id="section26sent4">Am I not a wanderer from my country, an outcast from my kinsfolk, an alien from my father’s house?</s><s id="section26sent5">Do not all men call me excommunicate, exile, desolate, disfranchised?</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">But</s><s id="section27sent2">Thou, Master, art my country, my kinsfolk, my paternal hearth, my franchise, my free speech, my great and glorious and inalienable wealth.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">Why</s><s id="section28sent2">then shall I not take courage to say what I feel?</s><s id="section28sent3">Why shall I not inquire of Thee and claim to learn something more?</s><s id="section28sent4">Yet I, who proclaim my confidence, confess in turn my fear and consternation, and still the fear and the confidence are not at war within me in separate camps, as one might suppose, but are blended in a harmony.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">I find then a feast</s><s id="section29sent2">which does not cloy in this blending, which has</s><s id="section29sent3">schooled my speech to be neither bold without caution, nor cautious without boldness.</s><s id="section29sent4">For I have learnt to measure my own nothingness, and to gaze with wonder on the transcendent heights of Thy loving-kindnesses.</s><s id="section29sent5">And when I perceive that I am earth and cinders or whatever is still more worthless, it is just then that I have confidence to come before</s><s id="section29sent6">Thee, when I am humbled, cast down to the clay, reduced to such an elemental state,</s><s id="section29sent7">as seems not even to exist.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">And the watchful</s><s id="section30sent2">pen of Moses has recorded this my soul’s condition in his memorial of me.</s><s id="section30sent3">For Abraham, he says, drew near and said, ‘Now I have begun to speak to the Lord, and I am earth and ashes’ (Gen. xviii. 27), since it is just when he knows his own nothingness that the creature should come into the presence of his Maker.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">The words ‘What wilt Thou give me?’</s><s id="section31sent2">are the cry not so much of uncertainty as of thankfulness for the multitude and greatness of the blessings which one has enjoyed.</s><s id="section31sent3">‘What wilt Thou give me?’
he says.</s><s id="section31sent4">Is there aught still left for me to expect?</s><s id="section31sent5">Lavish indeed,</s><s id="section31sent6">Thou bounteous God, are Thy gifts of grace, illimitable without boundary or end, welling up like fountains to replace and more than replace what we draw.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">But we should look not only</s><s id="section32sent2">to the ever-flowing torrent of Thy loving-kindnesses but also to the fields—they are ourselves—which are watered by them.</s><s id="section32sent3">For it the stream pour forth in over-abundance, the plain will be marshy and fenny, instead of fruitful soil.</s><s id="section32sent4">I need then that the inflow on me should be in due measure for fertility, not un-measured.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Therefore I will ask ‘What wilt Thou</s><s id="section33sent2">give me?’</s><s id="section33sent3">Thou whose gifts have been countless, almost to the very sum of what human nature can contain.</s></p></div>

<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">For man’s excellence must not tread the</s><s id="section35sent2">earth, but press upwards to heaven, that it may banquet there on incorruption and remain unscathed for ever.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">For I know that Thou, who givest</s><s id="section36sent2">being</s><s id="section36sent3">to what is not and generatest all things, hast hated the childless and barren soul, since</s><s id="section36sent4">Thou hast given as a special grace to the race of them that see that they should never be without children or sterile.</s><s id="section36sent5">And I myself having been made a member of that race justly desire an heir.</s><s id="section36sent6">For when I contemplate the race’s security from extinction, I hold it a deep disgrace to leave my own desire of excellence to come to naught.</s></p></div>
