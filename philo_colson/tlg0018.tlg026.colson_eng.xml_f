On Rewards and Punishments
(And Curses)
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">The oracles delivered through the prophet Moses</s><s id="section1sent2">are of three kinds.</s><s id="section1sent3">The first deals with the creation of the world, the second with history and the third with legislation.</s><s id="section1sent4">The story of the creation is told throughout with an excellence worthy of the divine subject, beginning with the genesis of Heaven and ending with the framing of man.</s><s id="section1sent5">For Heaven is the most perfect of things indestructible as man of things mortal, immortal and mortal being the original components out of which the Creator wrought the world, the one created then and there to take command, the other subject, as it were, to be also created in the future.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">The historical part is a record of</s><s id="section2sent2">good and bad lives and of the sentences passed in each generation on both, rewards in one case, punishments in the other.</s><s id="section2sent3">The legislative part has two divisions, one in which the subject matter is more general, the other consisting of the ordinances of specific laws.</s><s id="section2sent4">On the one hand there are the ten heads or summaries which we are told were not delivered through a spokesman but were shaped high above in the air into the form of articulate speech: on the other the specific ordinances of the oracles given through the lips of a prophet.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">All these and</s><s id="section3sent2">further the virtues which he assigned to peace and war</s><s id="section3sent3">have been discussed as fully as was needful in the preceding treatises, and I now proceed in due course to the rewards and punishments which the good and the bad have respectively to expect.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">After having schooled the citizens of his polity with</s><s id="section4sent2">gentle instructions and exhortations and more sternly with threats and warnings he called on them to make a practical exhibition of what they had learned.</s><s id="section4sent3">They advanced as it were into the sacred arena and showed the spirit in which they would act bared ready for the contest, to the end that its sincerity might be tested beyond doubt.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Then it was found</s><s id="section5sent2">that the true athletes of virtue did not disappoint the high hopes of the laws which had trained them, but the unmanly whose souls were degenerate through inbred weakness, without waiting for any stronger counter-force to overpower them, dropped down, a source of shame to themselves and derision to the</s><s id="section5sent3">spectators.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">And therefore, while the former enjoyed</s><s id="section6sent2">the prizes and laudatory announcements and all the other tributes which are paid to the victors, the latter departed not only without a crown but with the stigma of a defeat more grievous than those sustained in the gymnastic contests.</s><s id="section6sent3">For there the athletes’ bodies are brought low but can easily stand once more erect.</s><s id="section6sent4">Here it is whole lives that fall, which once overthrown can hardly be raised up again.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">The lessons which he gives on privilege, and</s><s id="section7sent2">honour, and on the other hand on punishments fall under heads arranged in an orderly series, individual men, families, cities, countries and nations, vast regions of the earth.</s><s id="section7sent3">We must first examine what is said of honours, as both more profitable and more pleasant to listen to, and we will begin with the honour paid to each single and particular individual.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">The Greeks say that the primeval hero</s><s id="section8sent2">Triptolemus</s><s id="section8sent3">borne aloft on winged dragons sowed the corn-seed over the whole earth, in order that in place of the acorns which had been their food the human race might have a kindly,</s><s id="section8sent4">wholesome and exceedingly palatable means of nourishment.</s><s id="section8sent5">Now this story like many others is a mythical fable and may be left to those whose way is to deal in marvels and cultivate sophistry rather than wisdom, and imposture rather than truth.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">For from the</s><s id="section9sent2">beginning at the first creation of all things God provided beforehand, raised from the earth, what was necessary for all living animals and particularly for the human race to which he granted sovereignty over all earthborn creatures.</s><s id="section9sent3">For none of the works of God is of later birth, but all that seems to be accomplished by human skill and industry in later time was there by the foresight of nature lying ready half made, thus justifying the saying that learning is recollection.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">But this is not</s><s id="section10sent2">a point for our present discussion.</s><s id="section10sent3">What we have to consider is that most vital form of seed which the Creator sowed in the rich soil of the rational soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">And the first thing thus sown is hope, the fountain</s><s id="section11sent2">head of the lives which we lead.</s><s id="section11sent3">In hope of gain the tradesman arms himself for the manifold forms of money getting.</s><s id="section11sent4">In hope of a successful voyage the skipper crosses the wide open seas.</s><s id="section11sent5">In hope of glory the ambitious man chooses political life and the charge of public affairs.</s><s id="section11sent6">The hope of prizes and crowns moves the training athlete to endure the contests of the arena.</s><s id="section11sent7">The hope of happiness incites also the devotees of virtue to study wisdom, believing that thus they will be able to discern the nature of all that exists and to act in accordance with nature</s><s id="section11sent8">and so bring to their fullness the best types of life, the contemplative and the practical, which necessarily make their possessor a happy man.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Now some have acted</s><s id="section12sent2">like enemies in war to the germs of hope, and consumed them in the fire of the vices which they have kindled in the soul or like careless husbandmen have through their laziness allowed them to perish.</s><s id="section12sent3">There</s><s id="section12sent4">are others who seem to have guarded them well but have clung to self-assertion rather than piety and regarded themselves as the source of their achievements.</s><s id="section12sent5">All these are to be condemned.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">He alone</s><s id="section13sent2">is worthy of approval who sets his hope on God both as the source to which his coming into existence itself is due and as the sole power which can keep him free from harm and destruction.</s><s id="section13sent3">What reward then is offered to the winner of the Crown in this contest?</s><s id="section13sent4">It is that living being whose nature is a mixture of the mortal and immortal, even man, not the same man nor yet another than the winner.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">The Hebrew</s><s id="section14sent2">name for him is Enos, and Enos translated into Greek is ἄνθρωπος or man.</s><s id="section14sent3">He takes the name which is common to the whole race as his personal name, a reward of special distinction implying that no one should be thought a man at all who does not set his hope on God.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">After the victory of hope comes the second</s><s id="section15sent2">contest, in which repentance is the champion.</s><s id="section15sent3">Repentance has nothing of that nature which remains ever in the same stay without movement or change.</s><s id="section15sent4">It has been suddenly possessed with an ardent yearning for betterment, eager to leave its inbred covetousness and injustice and come over to soberness</s><s id="section15sent5">and justice and the other virtues.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">Repentance</s><s id="section16sent2">also has two rewards assigned to its double achievement in abandoning the base and choosing the excellent.</s><s id="section16sent3">These rewards are a new home and a life of solitude; for he says of him who fled from the insurgency of the body to join the forces of the soul “he was not found because God transferred him.”</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">By “transference” he clearly signifies the new home</s><s id="section17sent2">and by “not found” the life of solitude.</s><s id="section17sent3">Very pertinently too.</s><s id="section17sent4">For if a man has really come to despise pleasures and desires and resolved in all sincerity to take his stand above the passions, he must prepare for a change of abode and flee from home and country and kinsfolk and friends without a backward glance.</s><s id="section17sent5">For great is the attraction of familiarity.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">We may fear that if he stays he may be cut off and captured by all the love charms which surround him and will call up visions to stir again the base practices which had lain dormant and create vivid memories of what it were well to have forgotten.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Many persons</s><s id="section19sent2">in fact have come to a wiser mind by leaving their country and have been cured of their wild and frenzied cravings when sight can no longer minister to passion the images of pleasure.</s><s id="section19sent3">For when thus dissociated it must needs be treading on empty space since the stimulus of pleasure is no longer present.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">And further if he changes his abode he</s><s id="section20sent2">must shun great gatherings and welcome solitude.</s><s id="section20sent3">It cannot but be that even in the foreign soil there are many snares like those at home on which the shortsighted who delight in large assemblies are sure to be pinned.</s><s id="section20sent4">For a crowd is another name for everything</s><s id="section20sent5">that is disorderly, indecorous, discordant, culpable, and to be carried along with the crowd is very detrimental to the virtue</s><s id="section20sent6">of the settler on his first arrival.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">For just as when men are beginning to</s><s id="section21sent2">recover from a long illness their bodies easily give way because their increase of strength is not yet firmly established, so in those whose soul is now for the first time becoming healthy the sinews of the mind are flabby and rickety, so that there is a danger that passion, which is naturally stimulated by association with the thoughtless, may break out afresh.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">After the contest won by repentance come a</s><s id="section22sent2">third set of rewards offered for justice.</s><s id="section22sent3">He who attains to justice receives two prizes, one his salvation amid the general destruction, the other his appointment to take into his charge and protection the specimens of each kind of living creatures, mated in couples to produce a second creation to make good the annihilation of the first.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">For the</s><s id="section23sent2">Creator judged it right that the same man should end the condemned and begin the innocent generation, thereby teaching by deeds and not by words those who deny that the world is governed by providence, that, under the law which</s><s id="section23sent3">He established in universal nature, all the myriads of the human race, if they have lived a life of injustice, are not worth a single man who has not departed from justice.</s><s id="section23sent4">This person, in whose day the great deluge took place, is called by the Greeks Deucalion and by the Hebrews Noah.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">After this Trinity comes another Trinity holier and</s><s id="section24sent2">dearer to God, all belonging to one family.</s><s id="section24sent3">For it was a Father, a Son, a Grandson who pressed forward to the same goal of life, namely to be well pleasing to the Maker and Father of all.</s><s id="section24sent4">All that the multitudes admire, glory, wealth and pleasure, they despised, and laughed at vanity, that web woven of lies and cunningly devised to deceive the beholders.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">Vanity</s><s id="section25sent2">is the impostor who deifies lifeless objects, the great and formidable engine of aggression who with its scheming and trickery beguiles every city and loses no time in capturing the souls of the young.</s><s id="section25sent3">For it sets up its abode in them and remains there from earliest infancy to old age, save in the cases where God illumines them with a ray of truth—truth the antagonist of vanity who retreats before it though slowly and reluctantly vanquished by its superior power.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">This</s><s id="section26sent2">kind is few in number but in power so</s><s id="section26sent3">manifold and mighty that it cannot be contained by the whole compass of the earth but reaches to Heaven, possessed with an intense longing to contemplate and for ever be in the company of things divine.</s><s id="section26sent4">After investigating the whole realm of the visible to its very end, it straightway proceeds to the immaterial and conceptual, not availing itself of any of the senses but casting aside all the irrational part of the soul and employing only the part which is called mind and reasoning.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">The leader in adopting</s><s id="section27sent2">the godly creed, who first passed over from vanity to truth, came to his consummation by virtue gained through instruction, and he received for his reward</s><s id="section27sent3">belief in God.</s><s id="section27sent4">To him who happily gifted by nature has acquired the virtue which listens to no other than itself, learns from no other, is taught by no other, the prize awarded is joy.</s><s id="section27sent5">The man of practice who by unwearied and unswerving labour has made the excellent his own has for his crown the vision of God.</s><s id="section27sent6">Belief in God, life-long joy, the perpetual vision of the Existent—what can anyone conceive more profitable or more august than these?</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">But let us look into each of them more carefully</s><s id="section28sent2">and not be led away by mere names but with a peering eye explore the inwardness of their full meaning.</s><s id="section28sent3">Now he who has sincerely believed in God has learned to disbelieve in all else, all that is created only to perish, beginning with the forces which so loudly assert themselves in him, reasoning and sense-perception.</s><s id="section28sent4">Each of these has assigned to it a council chamber and tribunal, where they conduct their inspections, one into the conceptual, the other into the visible, one with truth, the other with opinion for its goal.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">The instability and waywardness of opinion</s><s id="section29sent2">is obvious in that it is based on likelihoods</s><s id="section29sent3">and plausibilities, and every likeness by its deceptive resemblance falsifies the original.</s><s id="section29sent4">Reason, sense-perception’s master, who thinks itself appointed to judge things conceptual, which ever continue in the same stay, is found to be in sore trouble on many points.</s><s id="section29sent5">For when it comes to grapple with the vast</s><s id="section29sent6">number of particular subjects it becomes incapable, grows exhausted and collapses like an athlete flung prostrate by superior power.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">But he to whom it is</s><s id="section30sent2">given to gaze and soar beyond not only material but all immaterial things, and to take God for his sole stay and support with a reasonableness whose resolution falters not, and a faith unswerving and securely founded, will be a truly happy and thrice blessed man.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">After faith comes the reward set aside for the</s><s id="section31sent2">victorious champion who gained his virtue through nature and without a struggle.</s><s id="section31sent3">That reward is joy.</s><s id="section31sent4">For his name was in our speech “laughter” but as the Hebrews call it Isaac.</s><s id="section31sent5">Laughter is the outward and bodily sign of the unseen joy in the mind, and joy is in fact the best and noblest of the higher emotions.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">By it the soul is filled through and through</s><s id="section32sent2">with cheerfulness, rejoicing in the Father and Maker of all, rejoicing too in all His doings in which evil has no place, even though they do not conduce to its own pleasure, rejoicing because they are done for good and serve to preserve all that exists.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">A physician</s><s id="section33sent2">treating serious and dangerous diseases sometimes amputates parts of the body, hoping to secure the health of the rest, and the pilot in stormy weather casts cargo overboard to provide for the safety of the passengers.</s><s id="section33sent3">No blame attaches either to the physician for the mutilation or to the pilot for sacrifice of property, but on the contrary both are praised for looking to what is profitable rather than what is pleasant, and for having done the right thing.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">In the</s><s id="section34sent2">same way we must always reverence all-embracing nature and acquiesce cheerfully in its actions in the universe, free as they are from all intention of evil.</s><s id="section34sent3">For the question before us is not whether the events are pleasant to us personally but whether the chariot and ship of the universe is guided in safety like a well-ordered state.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">So he too is blessed no less than</s><s id="section35sent2">the first named.</s><s id="section35sent3">He never knows gloom and depression; his days are passed in happy freedom from fears and grief; the hardships and squalor of life never touch him even in his dreams, because every spot in his soul is already tenanted by joy.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">After the self-taught, the man enriched by his</s><s id="section36sent2">natural gifts, the third to reach perfection is the Man of Practice who receives for his special reward the vision of God.</s><s id="section36sent3">For having been in touch with every side of human life and in no half-hearted familiarity with them all, and having shirked no toil or danger if thereby he might descry the truth, a quest well worthy of such love, he found mortal kind set in deep darkness spread over earth and water and the lower air and ether too.</s><s id="section36sent4">For ether and the whole Heaven wore to his eyes the semblance of night, since the whole realm of sense is without defining bounds, and the indefinite is close akin, even brother, to darkness.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">In his former years the eyes of his soul had been</s><s id="section37sent2">closed, but by means of continuous striving he began though slowly to open them and to break up and throw off the mist which overshadowed him.</s><s id="section37sent3">For a beam purer than ether</s><s id="section37sent4">and incorporeal suddenly shone upon him and revealed the conceptual world</s><s id="section37sent5">ruled by its charioteer.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">That charioteer, ringed as he</s><s id="section38sent2">was with beams of undiluted light, was beyond his sight or conjecture, for the eye was darkened by the dazzling beams.</s><s id="section38sent3">Yet in spite of the fiery stream which flooded it, his sight held its own in its unutterable longing to behold the vision.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">The Father and</s><s id="section39sent2">Saviour perceiving the sincerity of his yearning in pity gave power to the penetration of his eyesight and did not grudge to grant him the vision of Himself in so far as it was possible for mortal and created nature to contain it.</s><s id="section39sent3">Yet the vision only showed that He is, not what He is.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">For this which is better</s><s id="section40sent2">than the good, more venerable than the monad, purer than the unit, cannot be discerned by anyone else; to God alone is it permitted to apprehend God.</s><s id="section40sent3">Now the fact that He is which can be apprehended under the name of His subsistence, is not apprehended by all or at any rate not in the best way.</s><s id="section40sent4">Some distinctly deny that there is such a thing as the Godhead.</s><s id="section40sent5">Others hesitate and fluctuate as though unable to state whether there is or not.</s><s id="section40sent6">Others whose notions about the subsistence of God are derived through habit rather than thinking from those who brought them up, believe themselves to have successfully attained to religion yet have left on it the imprint of superstition.</s></p></div>
