On the Confusion of Tongues
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">Enough has been said on these matters.</s><s id="section1sent2">The</s><s id="section1sent3">next question which demands our careful consideration is the confusion of tongues and the lessons of wisdom taught by Moses thereon.</s><s id="section1sent4">For he says as follows.</s><s id="section1sent5">“And all the earth was one lip and there was one voice to all.</s><s id="section1sent6">And it came to pass as they moved from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there.</s><s id="section1sent7">And a man said to his neighbour, Come, let us make bricks and bake them with fire.</s><s id="section1sent8">And the brick became as stone to them and the clay was asphalt to them.</s><s id="section1sent9">And they said, ‘Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower, whose head shall be unto heaven, and let us make our name before we are scattered abroad, on the face of all the earth.’</s><s id="section1sent10">And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men built.</s><s id="section1sent11">And the Lord said, ‘Behold, they have all one race and one lip, and they have begun to do this, and now nothing shall fail from them of all that they attempt to do.</s><s id="section1sent12">Come and let us go down and confuse their tongue there, that they may not understand each the voice of his neighbour.’</s><s id="section1sent13">And the Lord scattered them abroad thence on the face of all the earth, and they</s><s id="section1sent14">ceased building the city and the tower.</s><s id="section1sent15">Therefore the name of the city was called ‘Confusion,’ because the Lord confounded there the lips of the whole earth, and the Lord scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth” (Gen. xi. 1–9).</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">Persons who cherish a dislike of the institutions</s><s id="section2sent2">of our fathers and make it their constant study to denounce and decry the Laws find in these and similar passages openings</s><s id="section2sent3">as it were for their godlessness.”</s><s id="section2sent4">Can you still, “say these impious scoffers, “speak gravely of the ordinances as containing the canons of absolute truth?</s><s id="section2sent5">For see your so-called holy books contain also myths, which you regularly deride when you hear them related by others.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">And</s><s id="section3sent2">indeed,” they continue, “it is needless to collect the numerous examples scattered about the Law-book, as we might had we leisure to spend in exposing its failings.</s><s id="section3sent3">We have but to remind you of the instances which lie at our very feet and ready to our hand.”</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">One of these we have here, which resembles</s><s id="section4sent2">the fable told of the Aloeidae, who according to Homer the greatest and most reputed of poets planned to pile the three loftiest mountains on each other in one heap, hoping that when these were raised to the height of the upper sky they would furnish an easy road to heaven for those who wished to ascend thither.</s><s id="section4sent3">Homer’s lines on this subject run thus:</s><s id="section4sent4">They on Olympus Ossa fain would pile,
On Ossa Pelion with its quivering leaves,</s><s id="section4sent5">In hope thereby to climb the heights of heaven.</s><s id="section4sent6">Olympus, Ossa and Pelion are names of mountains.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">For these the lawgiver substitutes a</s><s id="section5sent2">tower which he represents as being built by the men of that day who wished in their folly and insolent pride to touch the heaven.</s><s id="section5sent3">Folly indeed; surely dreadful madness!</s><s id="section5sent4">For if one should lay a small foundation and build up upon it the different parts of the whole earth, rising in the form of a single pillar, it would still be divided by vast distances from the sphere of ether, particularly if we accept the view of the philosophers who inquire into such problems, all of whom are agreed that the earth is the centre of the universe.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Another</s><s id="section6sent2">similar story is to be found in the writings of the mythologists, telling of the days when all animals had a common language.</s><s id="section6sent3">The tale is that in old days all animals, whether on land or in water or winged, had the same language, and just as among men to-day Greeks talk with Greeks and barbarians with barbarians if they have the same tongue, so too every creature conversed with every other, about all that happened to be done to them or by them, and in this way they mourned together at misfortunes, and rejoiced together when anything of advantage came their way.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">For since community</s><s id="section7sent2">of language led them to impart to each other their pleasures and discomforts, both emotions were shared by them in common.</s><s id="section7sent3">As a result they gained a similarity of temperament and feeling until surfeited with the abundance of their present blessings they desired the unattainable, as so often happens, and wrecked their happiness thereon.</s><s id="section7sent4">They sent an embassy to demand immortality, asking that they might be exempted from old age and allowed to</s><s id="section7sent5">enjoy the vigour of youth for ever.</s><s id="section7sent6">They pleaded that one of their fellow-creatures, that mere reptile the serpent, had already obtained this boon, since he shed his old age and renewed his youth afresh, and it was absurd that the superior beings should fare worse than the inferior, or all than the one.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">However,</s><s id="section8sent2">for this audacity they were punished as they deserved.</s><s id="section8sent3">For their speech at once became different, so that from that day forward they could no longer understand each other, because of the difference of the languages into which the single language which they all shared had been divided.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">Now Moses, say the objectors, brings his</s><s id="section9sent2">story nearer to reality and makes a distinction between reasoning and unreasoning creatures, so that the unity of language for which he vouches applies to men only.</s><s id="section9sent3">Still even this, they say, is mythical.</s><s id="section9sent4">They point out that the division of speech into a multitude of different kinds of language, which Moses calls “Confusion of tongues,” is in the story brought about as a remedy for sin, to the end that men should no longer through mutual understanding be partners in iniquity, but be deaf in a sense to each other and thus cease to act together to effect the same purposes.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">But no good result appears to have</s><s id="section10sent2">been attained by it.</s><s id="section10sent3">For all the same after they had been separated into different nations and no longer spoke the same tongue, land and sea were constantly full of innumerable evil deeds.</s><s id="section10sent4">For it is not the utterances of men but the presence of the same cravings for sin in the soul which causes combination in wrongdoing.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Indeed men who have lost their</s><s id="section11sent2">tongue by mutilation do by means of nods and glances and the other attitudes and movements of the body indicate their wishes as well as the uttered word can do it.</s><s id="section11sent3">Besides a single nation in which not only language but laws and modes of life are identical often reaches such a pitch of wickedness that its misdeeds can balance the sins of the whole of mankind.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Again multitudes through ignorance of other</s><s id="section12sent2">languages have failed to foresee the impending danger, and thus been caught unawares by the attacking force, while on the contrary such a knowledge has enabled them to repel the alarms and dangers which menaced them.</s><s id="section12sent3">The conclusion is that the possession of a common language does more good than harm—a conclusion confirmed by all past experience which shews that in every country, particularly where the population is indigenous, nothing has kept the inhabitants so free from disaster as uniformity of language.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Further the acquisition of</s><s id="section13sent2">languages other than his own at once gives a man a high standing with those who know and speak them.</s><s id="section13sent3">They now consider him a friendly person, who brings no small evidence of fellow-feeling in his familiarity with their vocabulary, since that familiarity seems to render them secure against the chance of meeting any disastrous injury at his hands.</s><s id="section13sent4">Why then, they ask, did God wish to deprive mankind of its universal language as though it were a source of evil, when He should rather have established it firmly as a source of the utmost profit?</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Those who take the letter of the law in its</s><s id="section14sent2">outward sense and provide for each question as it arises the explanation which lies on the surface, will no doubt refute on their own principles the authors</s><s id="section14sent3">of these insidious criticisms.</s><s id="section14sent4">But we shall take the line of allegorical interpretation not in any contentious spirit, nor seeking some means of meeting sophistry with sophistry.</s><s id="section14sent5">Rather we shall follow the chain of logical sequence,</s><s id="section14sent6">which does not admit of stumbling but easily removes any obstructions and thus allows the argument to march to its conclusion with unfaltering steps.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">We suggest then</s><s id="section15sent2">that by the words “the earth was all one lip and one voice” is meant a consonance of evil deeds great and innumerable, and these include the injuries which cities and nations and countries inflict and retaliate, as well as the impious deeds which men commit, not only against each other, but against the Deity.</s><s id="section15sent3">These indeed are the wrongdoings of multitudes.</s><s id="section15sent4">But we consider also the vast multitude of ills which are found in the individual man, especially when the unison of voices within him is a disharmony tuneless and unmusical.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">Who does</s><s id="section16sent2">not know the calamities of fortune when poverty and disrepute combine with disease or disablement in the body, and these again are mixed with the infirmities of a soul rendered distracted by melancholy or</s><s id="section16sent3">senility, or any other grievous misfortune?</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">For</s><s id="section17sent2">indeed a single item of this list is enough to upset and overthrow even the very stoutest, if it brings its force to bear upon him.</s><s id="section17sent3">But when the ills of body and soul and the external world unite and in serried mass, as though obedient to a single commanding voice, bear down at the same moment upon their lone victim, what misery is not insignificant beside them?</s><s id="section17sent4">When the guards fall, that which they guard must fall too.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Now the guards</s><s id="section18sent2">of the body</s><s id="section18sent3">are wealth and reputation and honours, who keep it erect and lift it on high and give it a sense of pride, just as their opposites, dishonour, disrepute and poverty are like foes who bring it crashing to the ground.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Again the guards of the soul are the powers</s><s id="section19sent2">of hearing and sight and smell and taste, and the whole company of the senses and besides them health and strength of body and limb and muscle.</s><s id="section19sent3">For these serve as fortresses well-walled and stayed on firm foundations, houses within which the mind can range and dwell rejoicing, with none to hinder it from following the urges of its personality, but with free passage everywhere as on easy and open high roads.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">But against these guards also are posted hostile</s><s id="section20sent2">forces, disablement of the sense-organs and disease, as I have said, which often bid fair to carry the understanding over the precipice in their arms.</s><s id="section20sent3">While these calamities of fortune which work independently of us are full of pain and misery, they are far outweighed in comparison with those which spring from our deliberate volition.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">Let</s><s id="section21sent2">us turn, then, to where the voice of unison is the voice of our self-caused ills and consider it in its turn.</s><s id="section21sent3">Our soul, we are told, is tripartite, having one part assigned</s><s id="section21sent4">to the mind and reason, one to the spirited element and one to the appetites.</s><s id="section21sent5">There is mischief working in them all, in each in relation to itself, in all in relation to each other, when the mind reaps what is sown by its follies and acts of cowardice and intemperance and injustice, and the spirited part brings to the birth its fierce and raging furies and the other evil children of its womb, and the appetite sends forth on every side desires ever</s><s id="section21sent6">winged by childish fancy, desires which light as chance directs on things material and immaterial.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">For then, as though on</s><s id="section22sent2">a ship crew, passengers and steersmen had conspired through some madness to sink it, the first to perish with the boat are those who planned its destruction.</s><s id="section22sent3">It stands alone as the most grievous of mischiefs and one almost past all cure—this co-operation of all the parts of the soul in sin, where, as when a nation is plague-stricken, none can have the health to heal the sufferers, but the physicians share the sickness of the common herd who lie crushed by the pestilential scourge, victims of a calamity which none can ignore.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">We have a symbol of this dire</s><s id="section23sent2">happening in the great deluge described in the words of the lawgiver, when the “cataracts of heaven”</s><s id="section23sent3">poured forth the torrents of absolute wickedness in impetuous downfall and the “fountains from the earth,”</s><s id="section23sent4">that is from the body (Gen. vii. 11), spouted forth the streams of each passion, streams many and great, and these, uniting and commingling with the rainpour, in wild commotion eddied and swirled continually through the whole region of the soul</s><s id="section23sent5">which formed their meeting-place.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">“For the Lord</s><s id="section24sent2">God,” it runs, “seeing that the wickednesses of men were multiplied on the earth, and that every man carefully purposed in his heart evil things every day,” determined to punish man, that is the mind, for his deadly misdeeds, together with the creeping and flying creatures around him and the other unreasoning multitude of untamed beasts</s><s id="section24sent3">(Gen. vi. 5–6).</s><s id="section24sent4">This punishment was the deluge.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">For the deluge</s><s id="section25sent2">was a letting loose of sins, a rushing torrent of iniquity where there was naught to hinder, but all things burst forth without restraint to supply abundant opportunities to those who were all readiness to take pleasure therein.</s><s id="section25sent3">And surely this punishment was suitable.</s><s id="section25sent4">For not one part only of the soul had been corrupted, so that it might be saved through the soundness of others, but nothing in it was left free from disease and corruption.</s><s id="section25sent5">For “seeing,’’ as the scripture says, that “everyone,” that is every thought and not one only, “purposed,” the upright judge awarded the penalty which the fault deserved.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">These are they who made a confederacy at</s><s id="section26sent2">the salt ravine.</s><s id="section26sent3">For the place of vices and passions is hollow and rough and ravine-like; salt indeed, and bitter are the pangs which it brings.</s><s id="section26sent4">The covenant of alliance which they swore was destroyed by wise Abraham, for he knew that it had not the sanctity of oaths or covenant-rites.</s><s id="section26sent5">Thus we read “all these joined their voices to come to the salt-ravine; this is the salt sea” (Gen. xiv. 3). |</s><s id="section26sent6">Observe further those who were barren of wisdom 27 and blind in the understanding which should naturally be sharp of sight, their qualities veiled under</s><s id="section26sent7">their name of Sodomite</s><s id="section26sent8">—how the whole people from the young men to the eldest ran round and round the house of the soul to bring dishonour and ruin on those sacred and holy Thoughts which were its guests, its guardians and sentinels; how not a single one is minded to oppose the unjust or shrink from doing injustice himself.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">For we read that not merely some</s><s id="section27sent2">but the “whole people surrounded the house, both young and old” (Gen. xix.</s><s id="section27sent3">4), conspiring against the divine and holy Thoughts,</s><s id="section27sent4">who are often called angels.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">But Moses the prophet of God</s><s id="section28sent2">shall meet and stem the strong current of their boldness, though, setting before them as their king their boldest and most cunning eloquence, they come rushing with united onset, though they mass their wealth of water and their tide is as the tide of a river.</s><s id="section28sent3">“Behold,” he says, “the King of Egypt comes to the water, but thou shalt stand meeting him at the edge of the river” (Ex. vii.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">15).</s><s id="section29sent2">The fool, then, will</s><s id="section29sent3">go forth to the rushing flood of the iniquities and passions, which Moses likens to a river.</s><s id="section29sent4">But the wise man in the first place gains a privilege vouchsafed to him from God, who ever stands fast, a privilege which is the congener of His power which never swerves and never wavers.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">For it was said to</s><s id="section30sent2">him “Stand thou here with me” (Deut. v. 31), to the end that he should put off doubt and hesitation, the qualities</s><s id="section30sent3">of the unstable mind, and put on that surest and most stable quality, faith.</s><s id="section30sent4">This is his</s><s id="section30sent5">first privilege—to stand; but secondly—strange paradox—he “meets.”</s><s id="section30sent6">For “thou shalt stand meeting” says the text, though “meet” involves the idea of motion and “stand” calls up the thought of rest.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Yet the two things here spoken of are not</s><s id="section31sent2">really in conflict, but in most natural sequence to each other.</s><s id="section31sent3">For he whose constitution of mind and judgement is tranquil and firmly established will be found to oppose all those who rejoice in surge and tumult and manufacture the storm to disturb his natural capacity for calmness.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">It is</s><s id="section32sent2">well indeed that the opponents should meet on the lip or edge of the river.</s><s id="section32sent3">The lips are the boundaries of the mouth and a kind of hedge to the tongue and through them the stream of speech passes, when it begins its downward flow.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Now speech is an ally</s><s id="section33sent2">employed by those who hate virtue and love the passions to inculcate their untenable tenets, and also by men of worth for the destruction of such doctrines and to set up beyond resistance the sovereignty of those that are better, those in whose goodness there is no deceit.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">When, indeed, after they have let out</s><s id="section34sent2">every reef of contentious sophistry, the opposing onset of the sage’s speech has overturned their bark and sent them to perdition, he will, as is just and fit, set in order his holy choir to sing the anthem of victory, and sweet is the melody of that song.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">For</s><s id="section35sent2">Israel, it says, saw the Egyptians dead on the edge of the sea (Ex. xiv. 30)—not elsewhere.</s><s id="section35sent3">And when he says “dead” he does not mean the death which is the separation of soul and body, but the destruction of unholy doctrines and of the words which their mouth and tongue and the other vocal organs gave them to use.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Now the death of</s><s id="section36sent2">words is silence, not the silence which well-behaved people cultivate, regarding it as a sign of modesty, for that silence is actually a power, sister to the power of speech, husbanding the fitting words till the moment for utterance comes.</s><s id="section36sent3">No, it is the un-desired silence to which those whom the strength of their opponent has reduced to exhaustion and prostration must submit, when they find no longer any argument ready to their hand.</s></p></div>
