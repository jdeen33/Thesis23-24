On the Embassy to Gaius
(the first part of the treatise on virtues)
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">How long shall we the aged continue to be</s><s id="section1sent2">children grown grey in our bodies through length of years, but infants in our souls through want of sense, holding fortune, the most unstable of things, to be the most unchangeable, nature, the most constant, to be the most insecure?</s><s id="section1sent3">For we change our actions about from place to place as on a draught board, and fortune’s gifts seem to us more permanent than nature’s, nature’s more insecure than fortune’s.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">The reason is that, having no forethought for the</s><s id="section2sent2">future, we are ruled</s><s id="section2sent3">by the present, following erratic sense-perception rather than unerring intelligence.</s><s id="section2sent4">For the eyes of the body discern what is manifest and close at hand, but reason reaches to the unseen and the future.</s><s id="section2sent5">Reason’s vision, which is keener than the vision of the bodily eyes, we bedim and confuse, some with strong drink and surfeiting, others with that worst of evils, ignorance.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">| And yet</s><s id="section3sent2">the present time and the many important questions decided in it are strong enough to carry conviction even if some have come to disbelieve that the Deity</s><s id="section3sent3">takes thought for men, and particularly for the suppliants’ race which the Father and King of the Universe and the Source of all things has taken for his portion.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Now this race is called in the Hebrew</s><s id="section4sent2">tongue Israel, but, expressed in our tongue, the word is “he that sees God” and to see Him seems to me of all possessions, public or private, the most precious.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">For if the sight of seniors or instructors or</s><s id="section5sent2">rulers or parents stirs the beholders to respect for them and decent behaviour and the desire to live a life of self-control, how firmly based is the virtue and nobility of conduct which we may expect to find in souls whose vision has soared above all created things and schooled itself to behold the uncreated and divine, the primal good, the excellent, the happy, the blessed, which may truly be called better than the good, more excellent than the excellent, more blessed than blessedness, more happy than happiness itself, and any perfection there may be greater than these.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">For reason</s><s id="section6sent2">cannot attain to</s><s id="section6sent3">ascend to God, who nowhere can be touched or handled, but subsides and ebbs away unable to find the proper words by which it may approach to expound, I do not say the God who is, for if the whole Heaven should become an articulate voice, it would lack the apt and appropriate terms needed for this, but even for God’s attendant powers.</s><s id="section6sent4">Such are the creative, the kingly, the providential, and of the others all that are both beneficial and punitive,</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">assuming that</s><s id="section7sent2">the punitive are to be classed among</s><s id="section7sent3">the beneficial, not only on the ground that they are a part of laws and statutes, since no law can be complete unless it includes two provisions—honours for things good and punishment for things evil, but because the punishment of others often admonishes offenders and calls them to wisdom, or, certainly at any rate, their neighbours.</s><s id="section7sent4">For penalties are good for the morals of the multitude, who fear to suffer the like.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">For who that saw Gaius when after the death</s><s id="section8sent2">of Tiberius he succeeded to the sovereignty of the whole earth and sea, gained not by faction but established by law, with all parts, east, west, south, north, harmoniously adjusted, the Greek in full agreement with the barbarian, the civil with the military, to enjoy and participate in peace—who I say was not filled with admiration and astonishment at his prodigious and indescribable prosperity?</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">He found</s><s id="section9sent2">ready in hand a mass of accumulated goods, gold and silver, which he had inherited, some in bullion, some in specie, some as ornaments in the form of drinking-cups and other things which craftmanship produces for display; vast forces of infantry, cavalry, ships, revenues supplied like a perennial stream flowing from a fountain;</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">a dominion not confined to the</s><s id="section10sent2">really vital parts which make up most</s><s id="section10sent3">of the inhabited world, and indeed may properly bear that name, the world, that is, which is bounded by the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Rhine, the one dissevering us from the Germans and all the more brutish nations, the Euphrates from the Parthians and from the Sarmatians and Scythians, races which are no less savage than the Germans, but a dominion extending, as I said above, from the rising to the setting sun both within the ocean and beyond it.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">All these things were a joy to the Roman people and all Italy and the nations of Europe and Asia; not so much had they all exulted over any of his imperial</s><s id="section11sent2">predecessors.</s><s id="section11sent3">It was not now a matter of hoping that they would have the possession and use of good things public and private; they considered that they had already the plenitude as it were of good fortune with happiness waiting in its train.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Thus nothing was to be seen throughout the</s><s id="section12sent2">cities but altars, oblations, sacrifices, men in white robes and crowned with garlands, bright and smart, their cheery faces beaming with goodwill, feasts, assemblages, musical contests, horse races, revels, nightlong frolics with harp and flutes, jollification, unrestraint, holiday-keeping, every kind of pleasure ministered by every sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">In these days the rich</s><s id="section13sent2">had no precedence over the poor, nor the distinguished over the obscure, creditors were not above debtors, nor masters above slaves, the times giving equality before the law.</s><s id="section13sent3">Indeed, the life under Saturn, pictured by the poets, no longer appeared to be a fabled story, so great was the prosperity and well-being, the freedom from grief and fear, the joy which pervaded households and people,</s><s id="section13sent4">night and day, and lasted continuously without a break through the first seven months.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">But in the eighth month Gaius was struck down by</s><s id="section14sent2">severe sickness.</s><s id="section14sent3">He had exchanged the recent more homely and, therefore, healthier way of life which he had followed while Tiberius was alive, for one of extravagance.</s><s id="section14sent4">Hard drinking, luxurious feeding and appetites still unsatisfied when the cavities were stuffed full, hot baths, ill-timed, and acting as emetics, followed at once by renewed toping and gormandizing in its train, lasciviousness venting itself on boys and women, and everything else that can destroy soul and body and the bonds in both which keep them together, joined in the assault.</s><s id="section14sent5">Self-restraint is rewarded by strength and health, incontinence by infirmity and sickness bordering on death.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">The news of Gaius’s illness travelled every-where,</s><s id="section15sent2">since the time still made navigation possible.</s><s id="section15sent3">For it was the beginning of autumn, the close of the sailing season when the mariners return from then-trading ports everywhere to their own harbours and roadsteads, particularly those who take care not to winter in a foreign country.</s><s id="section15sent4">So people abandoned their luxurious life and became dismal.</s><s id="section15sent5">Every household and city was filled with anxiety and dejection, their recent joy being counter-balanced by a grief no less intense.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">For every part of the habitable world</s><s id="section16sent2">shared his sickness, and theirs was a sickness more grievous than that which overcame him.</s><s id="section16sent3">His was of the body only, theirs was felt by all and everywhere, affecting the well-being of the soul, their peace, their hopes and participation and enjoyment of every good thing.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">Thoughts of the many great evils which</s><s id="section17sent2">spring from anarchy occupied their mind: famine, war, ravaging, devastation of estates, loss of property, abductions, fears of enslavement and death, so deadly that no physician could cure them and the only remedy lay in the recovery of Gaius.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">|</s><s id="section18sent2">So when the</s><s id="section18sent3">sickness began to abate, in quite a short time it was known even to the inhabitants of the ends of the world, for nothing is more speedy than rumour, and every city was on edge, ever craving for a better report until the good news of his complete recovery was announced by the travellers who arrived.</s><s id="section18sent4">At this every continent, every island, returned once more to its former happiness, for they felt that they personally shared in his preservation.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">For no one</s><s id="section19sent2">remembers any single country or single nation feeling as much delight at the accession or preservation of a ruler, as was felt by the whole world in the case of Gaius, both when he succeeded to the sovereignty and when he recovered from his malady.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">They felt</s><s id="section20sent2">as if they were beginning for the first time to change a nomadic and brutish for a social and gregarious life, or were passing from desolate life in pens and huts on a mountain side to be settled in a walled city, or from an existence unprotected by a guardian, to take their place under a guardian, a shepherd of the civilized flock.</s><s id="section20sent3">Such was their joy but they did not know the truth.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">The human mind in its blindness</s><s id="section21sent2">does not perceive its real interest and all it can do is to take conjecture and guesswork for its guide instead of knowledge.</s><s id="section21sent3">So it was with Gaius.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">He who had been</s><s id="section22sent2">recently regarded as a saviour and benefactor, who would pour new streams of blessings on Asia and Europe, giving happiness indestructible to each singly</s><s id="section22sent3">and all in common, at once “ran amuck” as they say,</s><s id="section22sent4">changing to savagery, or rather revealing the brutality which he used to disguise under the mask of hypocrisy.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">His cousin, who had been left to share the</s><s id="section23sent2">sovereignty and was more entitled by kinship to the succession, since Gaius was the grandson of Tiberius by adoption while the other was by blood, he put to death on the pretext of conspiracy, though his age in itself precluded such an accusation.</s><s id="section23sent3">For the poor youth was just emerging from boyhood into adolescence.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">And according to some, if Tiberius had</s><s id="section24sent2">survived a little longer, Gaius would have been put out of the way, lying as he did under fatally damaging suspicions, and his real grandson would have been appointed sole ruler and heir to his grandfather’s sovereignty.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">But Tiberius was snatched away by</s><s id="section25sent2">fate before he had consummated his plans, while Gaius thought that by strategy he would escape the odium which dereliction in his duty to his partner would excite.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">|</s><s id="section26sent2">He employed the following</s><s id="section26sent3">artifice.</s><s id="section26sent4">Having summoned the chief officials he said,” In accordance with the will of the deceased Tiberius I wish the imperial authority to be shared by him who is my cousin by birth but my brother by affection, though you see yourselves that he is still a mere child and needs guardians and teachers and tutors.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">For what greater boon could there be than</s><s id="section27sent2">that a single soul or body should cease to be laden with the heavy burden of sovereignty and should have one who would be able to relieve and lighten them?</s><s id="section27sent3">And I,” he continued, “will be more than a guardian, a tutor and a teacher.</s><s id="section27sent4">I will appoint</s><s id="section27sent5">myself to be his father and him to be my son.”</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">With these words he deceived both</s><s id="section28sent2">the audience and the lad.</s><s id="section28sent3">The adoption was a snare to assure not the sovereignty which he expected, but the loss of that which he held already.</s><s id="section28sent4">And Gaius proceeded to plot against his fellow-heir and true partner with full security and disregard of all opposition, for the Roman laws assign absolute power over the son to the father, not to mention his irresponsible authority as emperor, since no one had either the courage or the power to call him to account for his actions of any kind.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">As the victor in the arena throws to the</s><s id="section29sent2">ground the one remaining champion, so dealt he, without pity for their fellowship in breeding, their kinship or his youth, with this unhappy lad, and sent to an early grave his co-regent, his co-heir who had been expected to be sole emperor as most nearly related to Tiberius, for grandsons when their fathers are dead hold the rank of sons in the eyes of their grandparents.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">|</s><s id="section30sent2">It is said, too, that the</s><s id="section30sent3">boy was ordered to kill himself with his own hands under the superintendence of a centurion and a chiliarch, who had been instructed to take no hand in the sacrilege on the grounds that it was unlawful that the descendants of emperors should be slain by others.</s><s id="section30sent4">For amid his lawless and unsanctified deeds Gaius remembered law and sanctity, a travesty of their true nature.</s><s id="section30sent5">But the lad lacked skill to do the deed, for he had never seen anyone else killed and had not yet been practised in the martial exercises which in view of the imminent prospect of war are used to give preliminary training to those who are being brought up to rule.</s><s id="section30sent6">So at first he stretched out his neck to the emissaries present and bade them</s><s id="section30sent7">dispatch him,</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">and when they could not bring themselves</s><s id="section31sent2">to do it, he took the sword himself and in his ignorance and inexperience asked them what was the most vital spot so that by a well-aimed blow he might break the thread of his miserable life.</s><s id="section31sent3">And they playing the part of preceptors in misery gave their instructions and showed him the part to which he should apply the sword, and having received this first and last lesson he was forced to become his own murderer, poor boy!</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">When Gaius had won this first and principal</s><s id="section32sent2">bout and no partner in his sovereignty was still left to divert the allegiance of ill-wishers and suspects, he at once prepared for a second effort, this time against Macro, who had been throughout his ally in establishing his power, not only after he was appointed emperor (for flattery never fails to pay court to success) but also earlier in helping him to get the sovereignty.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">For Tiberius, who always acted with</s><s id="section33sent2">profound prudence and was clever above all his contemporaries in divining a man’s secret wishes, and as much distinguished for shrewdness as for good fortune, often looked on Gaius with disfavour as being ill-disposed to the whole Claudian house and attached only</s><s id="section33sent3">to his mother’s family, and he feared for his grandson that if he was left alone when young he might be made away with.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">Moreover he</s><s id="section34sent2">doubted his fitness for an office of such magnitude, both because of his unsociable and unfriendly nature and also because of his erratic temperament, for he showed abnormal and crazy tendencies and maintained</s><s id="section34sent3">no consistency in word or deed.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">These faults</s><s id="section35sent2">Macro strove with all his might to remedy as opportunity offered and also to eradicate the suspicions of Tiberius on the subject which owing to his ceaseless fear for his grandson seemed to fester most in his mind.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Macro represented him as well-disposed and</s><s id="section36sent2">docile and so exceedingly devoted to the service of his cousin that family affection would make him willing to retire and leave him sole emperor.</s><s id="section36sent3">Modesty, he said, in many cases was a disadvantage, and it was his modesty which caused the simple-minded Gaius to be considered cunning.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">And when</s><s id="section37sent2">the plausibility of his arguments failed to convince Tiberius he would pledge his credit for their truth.</s><s id="section37sent3">“I guarantee it,” he said, “I have earned the right to be believed.</s><s id="section37sent4">I have given sufficient proof that I am in a special sense a friend of Caesar, a friend of Tiberius, when the task of attacking and destroying Sejanus was placed in my hand.”</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">And in general</s><s id="section38sent2">he was successful with his eulogies of Gaius, if eulogies is a suitable name for the defences directed to meet the vague charges and accusations based on suspicion.</s><s id="section38sent3">For in general the terms in which one might speak in commendation of brothers or sons in the full sense were used in equal or even greater measure of Gaius by Macro, when pleading his cause to Tiberius.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">|</s><s id="section39sent2">This was due, according to what most</s><s id="section39sent3">people said, not merely to the fact that Gaius in return courted the favour of Macro as possessing a predominant and, indeed, all-powerful influence in the government, but to Macro’s wife, though the charge against her was not mentioned.</s><s id="section39sent4">She every day incited and worked upon her husband not to abate his zeal and assistance of the young Gaius.</s><s id="section39sent5">A wife has great power to paralyse and seduce her husband</s><s id="section39sent6">and particularly if she is a wanton, for her guilty conscience increases her wheedling.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">The</s><s id="section40sent2">husband, unaware of the corruption of his marriage and household, and thinking that her wheedling is benevolence pure and simple, is deceived and little knows that her artifices are leading him to take his worst enemies to be his dearest friends.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">Knowing then that he had saved Gaius over</s><s id="section41sent2">and over again when within an ace of destruction, he gave his admonitions frankly and without disguise, for like a good builder he wished his handiwork to remain proof against destruction or dissolution either by himself or another.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">So whenever he saw Gaius</s><s id="section42sent2">asleep at a banquet he would wake him up with the double object of preserving propriety and his personal safety, since a sleeping man is an easy target for conspiracy.</s><s id="section42sent3">Or if he saw him frantic with excitement at the sight of dancers and sometimes joining in the dance, or greeting a mime of scandalous scenes and broad jesting with a loud youngster’s guffaw, instead of a subdued or sedate smile, or fascinated by the music of harpers or choric singers and occasionally accompanying them, he would sit or lean back at his side and nudge him and try to restrain him.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">Often,</s><s id="section43sent2">too, bending down to his ear so that no one else should listen, he would admonish him gently and quietly.</s><s id="section43sent3">“As a spectator,” he would say, “or listener, or using any other of your senses, you ought not to be like those around you or anyone else at all.</s><s id="section43sent4">In every side of life you ought to be as far above these as you have surpassed them in your good</s><s id="section43sent5">fortune.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">For it is not to be thought of that the</s><s id="section44sent2">sovereign of earth and sea should be overcome by a song or dancing or ribald jesting or anything of the kind, instead of always and everywhere remembering his sovereignty, that he is as a shepherd and master of a flock, and extracting for himself whatever may tend to betterment from everything whatever that is said or done.”</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section45"><s id="section45sent1">Then he would continue, “When</s><s id="section45sent2">you are attending theatrical or gymnastic competitions or those of the chariot race, do not pay regard to what the performers actually do, but to the moral achievement</s><s id="section45sent3">shown in their doings, and reason thus with yourself.</s></p></div>
<div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section46"><s id="section46sent1">If there are those who so labour on</s><s id="section46sent2">things which do not profit human life but merely provide pleasure and enjoyment to the spectator, so that they win praise and admiration and rewards and honours and crowns announced by proclamations, what should he do who has learnt the highest and greatest art?</s></p></div>
<div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section47"><s id="section47sent1">And the best and greatest art is the art of</s><s id="section47sent2">government which causes the good deep soil in lowlands and highlands to be tilled, and all the seas to be safely navigated by merchantships laden with cargoes to effect the exchange of goods which the countries in desire for fellowship render to each other, receiving those which they lack and sending in return those of which they carry a surplus.</s></p></div>
<div n="48" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section48"><s id="section48sent1">For envy has</s><s id="section48sent2">never gained the mastery over the habitable world, nor even of the great sections of it, the whole of Europe or the whole of Asia.</s><s id="section48sent3">But like a venomous reptile it creeps into tiny hiding-places, into a single man or a single house or, if the force of its blast be</s><s id="section48sent4">overstrong, into a single city.</s><s id="section48sent5">But to the wider circuit of a nation or country it has no entry, particularly since your family, the truly Augustan, began to hold sway over all and everywhere.</s></p></div>
