On the Unchangeableness of God
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“And after that,” says Moses, “when the angels</s><s id="section1sent2">of God went in unto the daughters of men and begat for themselves”</s><s id="section1sent3">(Gen. vi. 4).</s><s id="section1sent4">It is worth our while to consider what is meant by the word “after that.”</s><s id="section1sent5">The answer is that it is a reference back, bringing out more clearly something of what has been already stated.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">That something is his words about the divine</s><s id="section2sent2">spirit, that nothing is harder than that it should abide for ever in the soul with its manifold forms and divisions—the soul which has fastened on it the grievous burden of this fleshly coil.</s><s id="section2sent3">It is after that spirit</s><s id="section2sent4">that the angels or messengers go in to the daughters of men.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">For while the soul is illumined</s><s id="section3sent2">by the bright and pure rays of wisdom, through which the sage sees God and His potencies, none of the messengers of falsehood has access to the reason, but all are barred from passing the bounds which the lustral water has consecrated.</s><s id="section3sent3">But when the light of the understanding is dimmed and clouded, they who are of the fellowship of darkness win the day, and mating with the nerveless and emasculated passions, which he has called the daughters of men,</s><s id="section3sent4">beget offspring for themselves and not for God.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">For the offspring of God’s parentage are the perfect</s><s id="section4sent2">virtues, but the family of evil are the vices, whose note is discord.</s><s id="section4sent3">If thou wilt know, my mind, what it is to beget not for thyself, learn the lesson from the perfect Abraham.</s><s id="section4sent4">He brings to God the dearly loved, the only trueborn offspring of the soul, that clearest image of self-learned wisdom, named Isaac, and without a murmur renders, as in duty bound, this fitting thank-offering.</s><s id="section4sent5">But first he bound, as the law tells us, the feet of the new strange victim (Gen. xxii.</s><s id="section4sent6">9), either because having once received God’s inspiration he judged it right to tread no more on aught that was mortal, or it may be that he was taught to see how changeable and inconstant was creation, through his knowledge of the unwavering stedfastness that belongs to the Existent; for in this we are told he had put his trust (Gen. xv. 6).</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">He finds a disciple and</s><s id="section5sent2">successor in Hannah, the gift of the wisdom of God, for the name Hannah interpreted is “her grace.”</s><s id="section5sent3">She received the divine seed and became pregnant.</s><s id="section5sent4">And when she had reached the consummation of her travail, and had brought forth the type of character which has its appointed place in God’s order, which she named Samuel, a name which being interpreted means “appointed to God,” she took him and rendered him in due payment to the Giver, judging that no good thing was her own peculiar property, nothing, which was not a grace and bounty from God.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">For she speaks in the first book of Kings in this wise,</s><s id="section6sent2">“I give to Thee him, a gift</s><s id="section6sent3">” (1 Sam. i. 28), that is “who is a gift,” and so “I give him who has been given.”</s><s id="section6sent4">This agrees with the most sacred</s><s id="section6sent5">ordinance of Moses, “My gifts, My offerings, My fruits ye shall observe to bring to Me” (Num. xxviii.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">2).</s><s id="section7sent2">For to whom should we make thank-offering save to</s><s id="section7sent3">God? and wherewithal save by what He has given us?</s><s id="section7sent4">for there is nothing else whereof we can have sufficiency.</s><s id="section7sent5">God needs nothing, yet in the exceeding greatness of His beneficence to our race</s><s id="section7sent6">He bids us bring what is His own.</s><s id="section7sent7">For if we cultivate the spirit of rendering thanks and honour to Him, we shall be pure from wrongdoing and wash away the filthiness which defiles our lives in thought and word and deed.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">For it is absurd that a man should be forbidden to</s><s id="section8sent2">enter the temples save after bathing and cleansing his body, and yet should attempt to pray and sacrifice with a heart still soiled and spotted.</s><s id="section8sent3">The temples are made of stones and timber, that is of soulless matter, and soulless too is the body in itself.</s><s id="section8sent4">And can it be that while it is forbidden to this soulless body to touch the soulless stones, except it have first been subjected to lustral and purificatory consecration, a man will not shrink from approaching with his soul impure the absolute purity of God and that too when there is no thought of repentance in his heart?</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">He who is resolved not only to commit</s><s id="section9sent2">no further sin, but also to wash away the past, may approach with gladness: let him who lacks this resolve keep far away, since hardly shall he be purified.</s><s id="section9sent3">For he shall never escape the eye of Him who sees into the recesses of the mind and treads its inmost shrine.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">Indeed of the nature of the soul</s><s id="section10sent2">beloved of God no clearer evidence can we have than that psalm of Hannah which contains the words “the barren hath borne seven, but she that had many children hath languished” (1 Sam. ii.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">5). And yet it</s><s id="section11sent2">is the mother of one child—Samuel—who is speaking.</s><s id="section11sent3">How then can she say that she has borne seven?</s><s id="section11sent4">It can only be that in full accordance with the truth of things, she holds the One to be the same as the Seven,</s><s id="section11sent5">not only in the lore of numbers, but also in the harmony of the universe and in the thoughts of the virtuous soul.</s><s id="section11sent6">For Samuel who is appointed to God alone and holds no company with any other has his being ordered in accordance with the One and the Monad, the truly existent.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">But this condition</s><s id="section12sent2">of his implies the Seven, that is a soul which rests</s><s id="section12sent3">in God and toils no more at any mortal task, and has thus left behind the Six, which God has assigned to those who could not win the first place, but must needs limit their claims to the second.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">We might well</s><s id="section13sent2">expect, then, that the barren woman, not meaning the childless, but the “firm” or solid</s><s id="section13sent3">who still abounds in power, who with endurance and courage perseveres to the finish in the contest, where the prize is the acquisition of the Best, should bring forth the Monad which is of equal value with the Seven; for her nature is that of a happy and goodly motherhood.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">And when she says that she who had many children</s><s id="section14sent2">languishes, her words are as clear as they are true.</s><s id="section14sent3">For when the soul that is one departs from the one and is in travail with many, she naturally is multiplied a thousand-fold,</s><s id="section14sent4">and then weighed down and sore pressed by the multitude of children that cling to her—most of them abortions born out of due time—she languishes utterly.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">She brings forth the desires</s><s id="section15sent2">of which the eyes and the ears are the channels, these for shapes and colours, those for sounds; she</s><s id="section15sent3">is pregnant with the lusts of the belly and those which have their seat below it, and thus, under the crushing load of the many children that hang upon her, she grows faint and dropping her hands in weakness sinks in prostration.</s><s id="section15sent4">This manner of defeat is the lot of all who engender things corruptible for their corruptible selves.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">Some</s><s id="section16sent2">there are who through self-love have</s><s id="section16sent3">brought upon themselves not only defeat but death.</s><s id="section16sent4">Thus Onan “perceiving that the seed will not be his” (Gen. xxxviii.</s><s id="section16sent5">9), ceased not to destroy the reasoning principle, which in kind is the best of all existing things, till he himself underwent utter destruction.</s><s id="section16sent6">And right just and fitting was his fate.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">For if there</s><s id="section17sent2">shall be any whose every deed is self-seeking, who have no regard for the honouring of their parents, for the ordering of their children aright, for the safety of their country, for the maintenance of the laws, for the security of good customs, for the better conduct of things private and public, for the sanctity of temples, for piety towards God, miserable shall be their fate.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">To sacrifice life itself for any single one</s><s id="section18sent2">of these that I have named is honour and glory.</s><s id="section18sent3">But these self-lovers—they say that if these blessings, desirable as they are, were all put together, they would utterly despise them, if they should not procure them some future pleasure.</s><s id="section18sent4">And therefore God in His impartial justice will cast out to destruction that evil suggestion of an unnatural creed, called Onan.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">We must indeed reject all those</s><s id="section19sent2">who “beget for themselves,” that is all those who pursue only their own profit and think not of others.</s><s id="section19sent3">For they think themselves born for themselves only and not for the innumerable others, for father, for</s><s id="section19sent4">mother, for wife, for children, for country, for the human race, and if we must extend the list, for heaven, for earth, for the universe, for knowledge, for virtues, for the Father and Captain of all; to each of whom we are bound according to our powers to render what is due, not holding all things to be an adjunct of ourselves, but rather ourselves an adjunct of all.</s><s id="section19sent5">Enough on this point.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Let us extend our discussion</s><s id="section20sent2">to embrace the words that follow.</s><s id="section20sent3">“The Lord God,” says Moses, “seeing that the wickednesses of men were multiplied upon the earth and that every man intended evil in his heart diligently all his days, God had it in His mind that He had made man upon the earth, and He bethought Him.</s><s id="section20sent4">And God said, I will blot out man, whom I made, from the face of the earth” (Gen. vi.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">5–7).</s><s id="section21sent2">Perhaps some</s><s id="section21sent3">of those who are careless inquirers</s><s id="section21sent4">will suppose that the Lawgiver is hinting that the Creator repented of the creation of men when</s><s id="section21sent5">He beheld their impiety, and that this was the reason why He wished to destroy the whole race.</s><s id="section21sent6">Those who think thus may be sure that they make the sins of these men of old time seem light and trivial through the vastness of their own godlessness.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">For what greater impiety</s><s id="section22sent2">could there be than to suppose that the Unchangeable changes?</s><s id="section22sent3">Indeed some maintain</s><s id="section22sent4">that even among men vacillation of mind and judgement is not universal; for those who study philosophy in guilelessness
and purity, it is held, gain from their knowledge this as their chief reward, that they do not change with changing circumstances, but with unbending stedfastness and firm constancy take in hand all that it behoves them to do.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">It is a tenet</s><s id="section23sent2">of the lawgiver also that the perfect man seeks for</s><s id="section23sent3">quietude.</s><s id="section23sent4">For the words addressed to the Sage with God as the speaker, “stand thou here with Me” (Deut. v. 31), shew most plainly how unbending, unwavering and broad-based is his will.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">Wonderful</s><s id="section24sent2">indeed is the soul of the Sage, how he sets it, like a lyre,</s><s id="section24sent3">to harmony not with a scale of notes low and high, but with the knowledge of moral opposites, and the practice of such of them as are better; how he does not strain it to excessive heights, nor yet relax it and weaken the concord of virtues and things naturally beautiful, but keeps it ever at an equal tension and plays it with hand or bow in melody.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">Such a soul is the most perfect instrument fashioned</s><s id="section25sent2">by nature, the pattern of those which are the work of our hands.</s><s id="section25sent3">And if it be well adjusted, it will produce a symphony the most beautiful in the world, one which has its consummation not in the cadences and tones of melodious sound, but in the consistencies of our life’s actions.</s><s id="section25sent4">Oh!</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">if the soul of man, when</s><s id="section26sent2">it feels the soft breeze of wisdom and knowledge, can dismiss the stormy surge which the fierce burst of the gale of wickedness has suddenly stirred, and levelling the billowy swell can rest in unruffled calm under a bright clear sky, can you doubt that He, the Imperishable Blessed One, who has taken as His own the sovereignty of the virtues, of perfection itself and beatitude, knows no change of will, but ever holds fast to what He purposed from the first without any alteration?</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">With men then</s><s id="section27sent2">it must needs be that they are ready to change, through instability whether it be in themselves or outside them.</s><s id="section27sent3">So for example</s><s id="section27sent4">often when we have chosen our friends and been familiar with them for</s><s id="section27sent5">a short time, we turn from them, though we have no charge to bring against them, and count them amongst our enemies, or at best as strangers.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">Such</s><s id="section28sent2">action proves the facile levity of ourselves, how little capacity we have for stoutly holding to our original judgements.</s><s id="section28sent3">But God has no such fickleness.</s><s id="section28sent4">Or again, sometimes we are minded to hold to the standards we have taken but we find ourselves with others who have not remained constant, and thus our judgements perforce change with theirs.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">For a</s><s id="section29sent2">mere man cannot foresee the course of future events, or the judgements of others, but to God as in pure sunlight all things are manifest.</s><s id="section29sent3">For already</s><s id="section29sent4">He has pierced into the recesses of our soul, and what is invisible to others is clear as daylight to His eyes.</s><s id="section29sent5">He employs the forethought and foreknowledge which are virtues peculiarly His own, and suffers nothing to escape His control or pass outside His comprehension.</s><s id="section29sent6">For not even about the future can uncertainty be found with Him, since nothing is uncertain or future to God.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">No one doubts that the</s><s id="section30sent2">parent must have knowledge of his offspring, the craftsman of his handiwork, the steward of things entrusted to his stewardship.</s><s id="section30sent3">But God is in very truth the father and craftsman and steward of the heaven and the universe and all that is therein.</s><s id="section30sent4">Future events lie shrouded in the darkness of the time that is yet to be at different distances, some near, some far.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">But God is the maker of</s><s id="section31sent2">time</s><s id="section31sent3">also, for</s><s id="section31sent4">He is the father of time’s father, that is of the universe, and has caused the movements of the one to be the source of the generation of the other.</s><s id="section31sent5">Thus time stands to God in the relation of a grandson.</s><s id="section31sent6">For this universe, since we perceive it by our senses,</s><s id="section31sent7">is the younger son of God.</s><s id="section31sent8">To the elder son, I mean the intelligible universe, He assigned the place of firstborn, and purposed that it should remain in His own keeping.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">So this younger son, the world of our</s><s id="section32sent2">senses, when set in motion, brought that entity we call time to the brightness of its rising.</s><s id="section32sent3">And thus with God there is no future, since</s><s id="section32sent4">He has made the boundaries of the ages subject to Himself.</s><s id="section32sent5">For God’s life is not a time, but eternity, which is the archetype and pattern of time</s><s id="section32sent6">; and in eternity there is no past nor future, but only present existence.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Having now discoursed sufficiently on the</s><s id="section33sent2">theme that the Existent does not experience repentance, we will explain in due sequence the words “God had it in His mind that He had made men upon the earth and He bethought Him” (Gen. vi.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">6). “Having</s><s id="section34sent2">in one’s mind” and “bethinking,” the former being the thought quiescent in the mind,</s><s id="section34sent3">the latter the thought brought to an issue, are two most constant powers, which the Maker of all things has taken as His own and ever employs them when He contemplates</s><s id="section34sent4">His own works.</s><s id="section34sent5">Those of His creatures who do not leave their appointed places, He praises for their obedience.</s><s id="section34sent6">Those who depart from it He visits with the punishment which is the doom of deserters.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">This is explained by consideration of the</s><s id="section35sent2">different conditions, which</s><s id="section35sent3">He has made inseparable from the various bodies.</s><s id="section35sent4">These are in some cases cohesion, in others growth, in others life, in others a reasoning soul.</s><s id="section35sent5">Thus, in stones and bits of wood which have been severed from their organism, He wrought cohesion, which acts as the most rigid of bonds.</s><s id="section35sent6">Cohesion</s><s id="section35sent7">is a breath or current ever returning</s><s id="section35sent8">to itself.</s><s id="section35sent9">It begins to extend itself from the centre of the body in question to its extremes, and when it has reached the outermost surface it reverses its course, till it arrives at the place from which it first set out.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">This regular double course of cohesion</s><s id="section36sent2">is indestructible; and it is this which the runners imitate at the triennial festivals in the places of spectacle universal among men, and exhibit as a great and splendid feat, well worthy of their efforts.</s><s id="section36sent3">Growth God assigned to plants.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">It is a compound</s><s id="section37sent2">of many capacities, that of taking nourishment, that of undergoing change and that of increasing.</s><s id="section37sent3">Nourishment plants receive as they need it, as the following proof shews.</s><s id="section37sent4">When they are not watered they decay and wither, just as their increase when watered is plain to see, for sprouts heretofore too tiny to rise above the ground suddenly shoot up and become quite tall.</s><s id="section37sent5">It is hardly necessary to speak of their function of change.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">When the winter solstice arrives,</s><s id="section38sent2">the leaves wither and shed themselves to the ground, and the “eyes,” as the husbandmen call them, on the twigs close like eyes in animals, and all the outlets which serve to put forth life are bound tight, for Nature</s><s id="section38sent3">within them compresses herself and hibernates, to get a breathing-space, like an athlete after his first contest, and thus having regained her fund of strength, comes forth to resume the familiar conflict.</s><s id="section38sent4">And this comes to pass in the spring and summer seasons.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">For she arises as though from a</s><s id="section39sent2">deep sleep and unseals the eyes, opens wide the closed outlets, and brings forth all that is in her womb, shoots, twigs, tendrils, leaves and, to crown all, fruit.</s><s id="section39sent3">Then when the fruit is fully formed, she</s><s id="section39sent4">provides nourishment, like the mother to the infant, through some hidden channels, which correspond to the breasts in women, and she ceases not to minister this nourishment till the fruit is brought to its consummation.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">That consummation comes to the fully</s><s id="section40sent2">ripened fruit, when, if none pluck it, it automatically seeks to disengage itself from its organism, since it needs no longer the nurture which its parent supplies, and is capable, if it chance to drop on good soil, of sowing and producing other plants similar to those which gave it its existence.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">Life was made by its creator different from</s><s id="section41sent2">growth in three ways.</s><s id="section41sent3">It has sensation, “presentation,</s><s id="section41sent4">” impulse.</s><s id="section41sent5">For plants have no impulse, no
