<div id="Book-1" n="1" subtype="book" type="textpart">

On the special laws which fall under the two heads of the ten commandments, one of which is directed against the acknowledgement of other sovereign gods

  save the one, and the other against giving honours to the works of men’s hands

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section2sent1">The Ten Words, as they are called, the mainheads under which are summarized the Special Laws, have been explained in detail in the preceding treatise.</s><s id="Book2section2sent2">We have now, as the sequence of our dissertationrequires, to examine the particular ordinances.</s><s id="Book2section2sent3">I will begin with that which is an object of ridicule among many people.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section3sent1">Now the practicewhich is thus ridiculed, namely the circumcision of the genital organs, is very zealously observed by many other nations, particularly by the Egyptians, a race regarded as pre-eminent for its populousness, its antiquity and its attachment to philosophy.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section4sent1">Andtherefore it would be well for the detractors to desist from childish mockery and to inquire in a wiser and more serious spirit into the causes to which thepersistence of this custom is due, instead of dismissing the matter prematurely and impugning the good sense of great nations.</s><s id="Book2section4sent2">Such persons might naturally reflect that all these thousands in every generation undergo the operation and suffer severe pains in mutilating the bodies of themselves and their nearest and dearest, and that there are many circumstances which urge the retention and performance of a custom introduced by the men of old.</s><s id="Book2section4sent3">The principal reasons are four in number.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section5sent1">Oneis that it secures exemption from the severe and almost incurable malady of the prepuce called anthrax or carbuncle, so named, I believe, from the slow firewhich it sets up and to which those who retain the foreskin are more susceptible.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section6sent1">Secondly, it promotesthe cleanliness of the whole body as befits the consecrated order, and therefore the Egyptians carry the practice to a further extreme and have the bodies of their priests shaved.</s><s id="Book2section6sent2">For some substances which need to be cleared away collect and secrete themselves both in the hair and the foreskin.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section7sent1">Thirdly, it assimilatesthe circumcised member to theheart.</s><s id="Book2section7sent2">For as both are framed to serve for generation, thought being generated by the spirit force in the heart,living creatures by the reproductive organ,the earliest menheld that the unseen and superior element to which the concepts of the mind owe their existence should have assimilated to it the visible and apparent, the natural parent of the things perceived by sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section8sent1">The fourth and most vital reason is itsadaptation to give fertility of offspring, for we are told that it causes the semen to travel aright without being scattered or dropped into the folds of the foreskin, and therefore the circumcised nations appear to be the most prolific and populous.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section9sent1">These are the explanations handed down to usfrom the old-time studies of divinely gifted men who made deep research into the writings of Moses.</s><s id="Book2section9sent2">To these I would add that I consider circumcision to be a symbol of two things most necessary to our well-being.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section10sent1">One is the excision of pleasures which bewitchthe mind.</s><s id="Book2section10sent2">For since among the love-lures of pleasure the palm is held by the mating of man and woman, the legislators thought good to dock the organ which ministers to such intercourse, thus making circumcision the figure of the excision of excessiveand superfluous pleasure, not only of one pleasure but of all the other pleasures signified by one, and that the most imperious.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section11sent1">The otherreason is that a man should know himself and banish from the soul the grievous malady of conceit.</s><s id="Book2section11sent2">For there are some who have prided themselves on their power of fashioning as with a sculptor’s cunning the fairest of creatures, man, and in their braggart pride assumed godship, closing their eyes to the Cause of all that comes into being, though they might findin their familiars a corrective for their delusion.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section12sent1">Forin their midst are many men incapable of begetting and many women barren, whose matings are ineffective and who grow old childless.</s><s id="Book2section12sent2">The evil belief, therefore, needs to be excised from the mind with any others that are not loyal to God.</s><s id="Book2section12sent3">So much for these matters.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section13sent1">We must now turnto the particular laws, taking those first with which it is well to begin, namely those the subject of which is the sole sovereignty of God.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section14sent1">Some have supposed that the sun and moonand the other stars were gods with absolute powers and ascribed to them the causation of all events.</s><s id="Book2section14sent2">But Moses held that the universe was created and is in a sense the greatest of commonwealths, having magistrates and subjects; for magistrates, all the heavenly bodies, fixed or wandering; for subjects, such beings as exist below the moon, in the air or on the earth.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section15sent1">The said magistrates, however, in his viewhave not unconditional powers, but are lieutenants of the one Father of All, and it is by copying the example of His government exercised according to law and justice over all created beings that they acquit themselves aright; but those who do not descry the Charioteer mounted above attribute the causation of all the events in the universe to the team that draw the chariot as though they were sole agents.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section16sent1">From this ignorance our most holy lawgiver wouldconvert them to knowledge with these words: “Do not when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars and all the ordered host of heaven go astray andworship them.</s><s id="Book2section16sent2">”Well indeed and aptly does he call the acceptance of the heavenly bodies as gods a going astray or wandering.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section17sent1">For those who see the sunwith its advances and retreats producing the yearly seasons in which the animals and plants and fruits are brought at fixed periods of time from their birth to maturity, and the moon as handmaid and successor to the sun taking over at night the care and supervision of all that he had charge of by day, and the other stars in accordance with their sympathetic affinity to things on earth acting and working in a thousand ways for the preservation of the All, have wandered infinitely far in supposing that they alone are gods.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section18sent1">But if they had been at pains to walk inthat road where there is no straying, they would at once have perceived that just as sense is the servitor of mind, so too all the beings perceived by sense are the ministers of Him who is perceived by the mind.</s><s id="Book2section18sent2">It is enough for them if they gain the second place.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section19sent1">For it is quite ridiculous to deny that if the mind inus, so exceedingly small and invisible, is yet the ruler of the organs of sense, the mind of the universe, so transcendently great and perfect, must be the King of kings who are seen by Him though He is not seen by them.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section20sent1">So all the gods which sense descries inHeaven must not be supposed to possess absolute power but to have received the rank of subordinate rulers, naturally liable to correction, though in virtue of their excellence never destined to undergo it.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section21sent1">Therefore carrying our thoughts beyond all the realmof visible existence let us proceed to give honour to the Immaterial, the Invisible, the Apprehended by the understanding alone, who is not only God of gods, whether perceived by sense or by mind, butalso the Maker of all.</s><s id="Book2section21sent2">And if anyone renders the worship due to the Eternal, the Creator, to a created being and one later in time, he must stand recorded as infatuated and guilty of impiety in the highest degree.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section22sent1">There are some who put gold and silver in thehands of sculptors as though they were competent to fashion gods; and the sculptors taking the crude material and furthermore using mortal form for their model, to crown the absurdity shape gods, as they are supposed to be.</s><s id="Book2section22sent2">And after erecting and establishing temples they have built altars and in their honour hold sacrifices and processions with other religious rites and ceremonies conducted with the most elaborate care, and the vain shew is treated by priests and priestesses with the utmost possible solemnity.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section23sent1">Such idolaters are warned by the Ruler of All in thesewords: “Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver and gold,” and the lesson conveyed is little less than a direct command,“Neither shall ye make gods the work of your hands from any other material if you are prevented from using the best,” for silver and gold hold first place among the sculptor’s materials.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section24sent1">But apart from the literal prohibition,He seems to me to suggest another thought of great value for the promotion of morality,and to condemn strongly the money-lovers who procure gold and silver coins from every side and treasure their hoard like adivine image in a sanctuary, believing it to be a source of blessing and happiness of every kind.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section25sent1">Andfurther, all the needy who are possessed by that grievous malady, the desire for money, though they have no wealth of their own on which they may bestow worship as its due, pay awe-struck homage to that of their neighbours, and come at early dawn to the houses of those who have abundance of it as though they were the grandest temples, there to make their prayers and beg for blessing from the masters as though they were gods.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section26sent1">To such he sayselsewhere “Ye shall not follow idols and ye shall not make molten gods,”thus teaching them in a figure that it is not fitting to assign divine honours to wealth.</s><s id="Book2section26sent2">For it is the nature of the far-famed materials of wealth, gold and silver, to melt,and they are followed by the multitude who think that what “blind”wealth has to give is the sole or the chief source of happiness.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section27sent1">It is these that he calls “idols,” like toshadows and phantoms, with nothing firm or strong to which they can cling.</s><s id="Book2section27sent2">They are borne along like a restless wind, subject to every kind of change and alteration.</s><s id="Book2section27sent3">And of this we have a clear proof.</s><s id="Book2section27sent4">Sometimes they suddenly light on one who has never owned them ere now: then again, when he thinks that they are firmly grasped, they spring away.</s><s id="Book2section27sent5">And indeed when they are present, the apparition is like idols or images seen through mirrors, deceiving andbewitching the sense and seeming to subsist when they have no abiding substance.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section28sent1">And why need weprove that human riches or human vanity, which empty-headed thinking paints in such bright colours, are unstable?</s><s id="Book2section28sent2">For we know that someassert that all other living creatures and plants which are born and perish are in a constant and ceaseless state of flux, though our perception of the effluence is indistinct, because the swiftness of its course always defeats the efforts of the eyesight to observe it with exactness.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section29sent1">But not only wealth and glory and the likeare idols and unsubstantial shadows, but also all those personages, which the myth-makers have invented and spread delusion therewith, building up their false imaginations into a stronghold to menace the truth, and staging as by machinerynew gods, in order that the eternal and really existing God might be consigned to oblivion.</s><s id="Book2section29sent2">And to promote the seductiveness they have fitted the falsehood into melody, metre and rhythm,thinking to cajole their audience thereby.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section30sent1">Further, too, they have broughtin sculpture and painting to co-operate in the deception, in order that with the colours and shapes and artistic qualities wrought by their fine workmanship they may enthrall the spectators and so beguile the two leading senses, sight and hearing—sight through lifeless shapes of beauty, hearing through the charm of poetry and music—and thus make the soul unsteady and unsettled and seize it for their prey.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section31sent1">Therefore knowing that vanity had attained highpower and was championed by the greater part of the human race, not under compulsion but of their own free will, and fearing lest the devotees of piety, true and incorruptible, might be swept away as by a torrent, he stamped upon their minds as with a seal deep imprints of holiness, so that no fusion or smoothing in the course of years should ever blur their distinctness.</s><s id="Book2section31sent2">This lesson he continually repeats, sometimes saying that God is one and the Framer and Maker of all things, sometimes that He is Lord of created beings, because stability and fixity and lordship are by nature vested in Him alone.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section32sent1">We aretold, too, that “those who cling to the God that is all live.</s><s id="Book2section32sent2">”Is not this the thrice-happy and thrice-blessed life, to cling lovingly to the service of the most ancient Cause of all and to reject the thought of serving the menials and the door-keepers rather than the King?</s><s id="Book2section32sent3">This true life stands inscribed on the tables of nature as deathless and agelong, and the writing that records it must endure with the universe to all eternity.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section33sent1">Doubtless hard to unriddle and hard to apprehendis the Father and Ruler of all, but that is no reason why we should shrink from searching for Him.</s><s id="Book2section33sent2">But in such searching two principal questions arise which demand the consideration of the genuine philosopher.</s><s id="Book2section33sent3">One is whether the Deity exists, a question necessitated by those who practise atheism, the worst form of wickedness, the other is what the Deity is in essence.</s><s id="Book2section33sent4">Now to answer the first questiondoes not need much labour, but the second is not only difficult but perhaps impossible to solve.</s><s id="Book2section33sent5">Still, both must be examined.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section34sent1">We see then that anypiece of work always involves the knowledge of a workman.</s><s id="Book2section34sent2">Who can look upon statutes or painting without thinking at once of a sculptor or painter?</s><s id="Book2section34sent3">Who can see clothes or ships or houses without getting the idea of a weaver and a shipwright and a house-builder?</s><s id="Book2section34sent4">And when one enters a well-ordered city in which the arrangements for civil life are very admirably managed, what else will he suppose but that this city is directed by good rulers?</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section35sent1">So thenhe who comes to the truly Great City, this world, and beholds hills and plains teeming with animals and plants, the rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, streaming along, the seas with their expanses, the air with its happily tempered phases, the yearly seasons passing into each other,and then the sun and moon ruling the day and night, and the other heavenly bodies fixed or planetary and the whole firmament revolving in rhythmic order, must he not naturally or rather necessarily gain the conception of the Maker and Father and Ruler also?</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section36sent1">For none of the worksof human art is self-made, and the highest art and knowledge is shewn in this universe, so that surely it has been wrought by one of excellent knowledge and absolute perfection.</s><s id="Book2section36sent2">In this way we have gained the conception of the existence of God.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section37sent1">As for the divine essence, though in fact it ishard to track and hard to apprehend, it still calls for all the inquiry possible.</s><s id="Book2section37sent2">For nothing is better than to search for the true God, even if the discovery of Him eludes human capacity, since the very wish to learn, if earnestly entertained, produces untold joys and pleasures.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section38sent1">We have the testimony of those whohave not taken a mere sip of philosophy but have feasted more abundantly on its reasonings and conclusions.</s><s id="Book2section38sent2">For with them the reason soars away from earth into the heights, travels through the upper air and accompanies the revolutions of the sun and moon and the whole heaven and in its desire to see all that is there finds its powers of sight blurred, for so pure and vast is the radiance that pours therefrom that the soul’s eye is dizzied by the flashing of the rays.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section39sent1">Yet it does not therefore faintheartedly give up thetask, but with purpose unsubdued presses onwards to such contemplation as is possible, like the athlete who strives for the second prize since he has been disappointed of the first.</s><s id="Book2section39sent2">Now second to the true vision stands conjecture and theorizing and all that can be brought into the category of reasonable probability.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section40sent1">So then just as, though we do not knowand cannot with certainty determine what each of the stars is in the purity of its essence, we eagerly persist in the search because our natural love of learning makes us delight in what seems probable,</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section41sent1">so too,though the clear vision of God as He really is is denied us, we ought not to relinquish the quest.</s><s id="Book2section41sent2">For the very seeking, even without finding, is felicity in itself, just as no one blames the eyes of the body because when unable to see the sun itself they see the emanation of its rays as it reaches the earth, which is but the extremity of the brightness which the beams ofthe sun give forth.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section42sent1">It was thiswhich Moses the sacred guide, most dearly beloved of God, had before his eyes when he besought God with the words, “Reveal Thyself to me.</s><s id="Book2section42sent2">”In these words we may almost hear plainly the inspired cry”This universe has been my teacher, to bring me to the knowledge that Thou art and dost subsist.</s><s id="Book2section42sent3">AsThy son, it has told me of its Father, as Thy work of its contriver.</s><s id="Book2section42sent4">But what Thou art in Thy essence I desire to understand, yet find in no part of the All any to guide me to this knowledge.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section43sent1">Therefore I pray andbeseechThee to accept the supplication of a suppliant, a lover of God, one whose mind is set to serveThee alone; for as knowledge of the light does not come by any other source but what itself supplies, so tooThou alone canst tell me of Thyself.</s><s id="Book2section43sent2">Wherefore I crave pardon if, for lack of a teacher, I venture to appeal to Thee in my desire to learn of Thee.”</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section44sent1">He replies, “Thy zeal I approve as praiseworthy, butthe request cannot fitly be granted to any that are brought into being by creation.</s><s id="Book2section44sent2">I freely bestow what is in accordance with the recipient; for not all that I can give with ease is within man’s power to take, and therefore to him that is worthy of My grace I extend all the boons which he is capable of receiving.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section45sent1">But the apprehension of Me is something more thanhuman nature, yea even the whole heaven anduniverse will be able to contain.</s><s id="Book2section45sent2">Know thyself, then, and do not be led away by impulses and desires beyond thy capacity, nor let yearning for the unattainable uplift and carry thee off thy feet, for of the obtainable nothing shall be denied thee.”</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section46sent1">WhenMoses heard this, he addressed to Him a second petition and said, ” I bow before Thy admonitions, that I never could have received the vision of Thee clearly manifested, but I beseechThee that I may at least see the glory that surrounds</s><s id="Book2section46sent2">Thee, and by Thy glory I understand the powers that keep guard around</s><s id="Book2section46sent3">Thee, of whom I would fain gain apprehension, for though hitherto that has escaped me, the thought of it creates in me a mighty longing to have knowledge of them.”</s></p></div>
<div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section47sent1">To this He answers, “The powers whichthou seekest to know are discerned not by sight but by mind even as I, Whose they are, am discerned by mind and not by sight, and when I say ‘they are discerned by mind’I speak not of thosewhich are now actually apprehended by mind but mean that if these other powers could be apprehended it would not be by sense but by mind at its purest.</s></p></div>
<div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section48sent1">But while in theiressence they are beyond your apprehension, they nevertheless present to your sight a sort of impress and copy of their active working.</s><s id="Book2section48sent2">You men have for your use seals which when brought into contact with wax or similar material stamp on them any number of impressions while they themselves are not docked in any part thereby but remain as they were.</s><s id="Book2section48sent3">Such you must conceiveMy powers to be, supplying quality and shape to things which lack either and yet changing or lessening nothing of their eternal nature.</s></p></div>
<div n="48" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section49sent1">Some among you call them not inaptly ‘forms’ or‘ideas,’since they bring form into everything that is, giving order to the disordered, limit to the unlimited, bounds to the unbounded, shape to the shapeless, and in general changing the worse to something better.</s></p></div>
<div n="49" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section50sent1">Do not, then, hope to be ever able to apprehend Meor any of My powers in Our essence.</s><s id="Book2section50sent2">But I readily and with right goodwill will admit you to a share of what is attainable.</s><s id="Book2section50sent3">That means that I bid you come and contemplate the universe and its contents, a spectacle apprehended not by the eye of the body but by the unsleeping eyes of the mind.</s></p></div>
<div n="50" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section51sent1">Only let therebe the constant and profound longing for wisdom which fills its scholars and disciples with verities glorious in their exceeding loveliness.</s><s id="Book2section51sent2">”When Moses heard this, he did not cease from his desire but kept the yearning for the invisible aflame in his heart.</s></p></div>
<div n="51" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section52sent1">All of like sort to him, all who spurn idle fablesand embrace truth in its purity, whether they have been such from the first or through conversion to the better side have reached that higher state, obtain Hisapproval, the former because they were not false to the nobility of their birth, the latter because their judgement led them to make the passage to piety.</s><s id="Book2section52sent2">These last he calls “proselytes,” or newly-joined, because they have joined the new and godlycommonwealth.</s></p></div>
<div n="52" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section53sent1">Thus, while giving equal rankto all in-comers with all the privileges which he gives to the native-born, he exhorts the old nobility to honour them not only with marks of respect but with special friendship and with more than ordinary good-will.</s><s id="Book2section53sent2">And surely there is good reason for this; they have left, he says, their country, their kinsfolk and their friends for the sake of virtue and religion.</s><s id="Book2section53sent3">Let them not be denied another citizenship or other ties of family and friendship, and let them find places of shelter standing ready for refugees to the camp of piety.</s><s id="Book2section53sent4">For the most effectual love-charm, the chain which binds indissolubly the goodwill which makes us one is to honour the one God.</s></p></div>

<div n="245" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section246sent1">It is natural thereforethat the flesh should be consumed by fire in imitationof the whole-burnt-offerings to do honour to the persons concerned, not because God’s holy judgements are given by considerations of position but because the sins of the greatly virtuous and the truly sacred are such as to be regarded as acts of righteousness if done by others.</s></p></div>

<div n="139" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section485sent1">Being gifted with a power to judge justly, it reflected that the father had bestowed his bounties generously on the children of the beloved wifebecause of his affection for her, but left the children of the hated wife entirely out of consideration owing to his hostility to their mother, so that the former even in his lifetime inherited more than their equal share, and the latter might expect at his death to find themselves robbed of the whole patrimony.</s><s id="Book2section485sent2">And therefore it decreed that the son of the discarded wife should have the eldest son’s privilege of the double share, in order to equalize the partition between both families.</s><s id="Book2section485sent3">Enough on these matters.</s></p></div>

<div n="142" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section488sent1">The fourth reasonis, that the moon traverses the zodiac in a shorter fixed period than any other heavenly body.</s><s id="Book2section488sent2">For it accomplishes that revolution in the span of a single month, and therefore the conclusion of its circuit, when the moon ends its course at the starting-point at which it began, is honoured by the law, which declares that day a feast, again to teach us an admirable lesson, that in the conduct of life we should make the ends correspond with the beginnings.</s><s id="Book2section488sent3">And this will be effected if we keep our primitive appetites under the control of reason and do not permit them to rebel and riot like cattle that have no herdsman.</s></p></div>

<div n="153" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book2section499sent1">But the month of theautumnal equinox, though first in order as measured by the course of the sun, is not called first in the law,because at that time all the fruits have been gathered in and the trees are shedding their leaves and all the bloom which the spring brought in its prime already scorched by the heat of the summer sun is wilting under the dry currents of air.</s></p></div>
