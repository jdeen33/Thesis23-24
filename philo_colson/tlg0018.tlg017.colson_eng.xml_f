On Flight and Finding
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“And Sarai evil-entreated her, and she fled</s><s id="section1sent2">from her face.</s><s id="section1sent3">And an angel of the Lord found her at the fountain of water in the wilderness, at the fountain in the way to Shur.</s><s id="section1sent4">And the angel of the Lord said unto her, ‘Handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou?</s><s id="section1sent5">and whither goest thou?’</s><s id="section1sent6">And she said, ‘From the face of Sarai my mistress I am fleeing.’</s><s id="section1sent7">And the angel of the Lord said unto her, ‘Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hands’ (Gen. xvi. 6–9).</s><s id="section1sent8">And the angel of the Lord said unto her, ‘Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the Lord hath hearkened to thy humiliation.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">He shall be a dweller in the fields; his hands shall be against all men, and all men’s hands shall be against him’“ (ibid. 11, 12).</s><s id="section2sent2">Having in the</s><s id="section2sent3">preceding treatise said what was fitting about the courses of preliminary training and about evilentreatment, we will next proceed to set forth the subject of fugitives.</s><s id="section2sent4">For the Lawgiver has in several places made mention of those who run away, as he does here, saying of Hagar that upon being evil-entreated “she ran away from the face of her mistress.”</s><s id="section2sent5">There are, I think, three motives for flight:</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">hatred,</s><s id="section3sent2">fear, and shame.</s><s id="section3sent3">From hatred wives leave husbands</s><s id="section3sent4">and husbands wives; from fear children leave their parents and servants their masters; from shame friends leave their fellows when something they have done displeases them.</s><s id="section3sent5">I know fathers whose effeminacy has made them unwilling to face the strict and philosophic life of their sons, and who out of shame have chosen to live in the country instead of in the city.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Instances of the working of these</s><s id="section4sent2">three motives are to be found in the sacred writings.</s><s id="section4sent3">Jacob, the Practiser, as we shall presently shew, flies from his father-in-law Laban out of hatred, from his brother Esau out of fear.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Hagar’s motive</s><s id="section5sent2">for departing is shame.</s><s id="section5sent3">A sign of this is the fact that an angel, a Divine Word, meets her to advise the right course, and to suggest return to the house of her mistress.</s><s id="section5sent4">This angel addresses her in the encouraging words, “The Lord hath hearkened to thy humiliation” (Gen. xvi. 11), a humiliation prompted neither by fear nor by hatred, the one the feeling of an ignoble, the other of a quarrelsome soul, but by shame, the outward expression of inward modesty.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Had she run away</s><s id="section6sent2">owing to fear, the angel would probably have moved her who had inspired the fear to a gentler frame of mind; for then, and not till then, would it have been safe for the fugitive to go back.</s><s id="section6sent3">But no angel first approached Sarai, seeing that she is favourably disposed of her own accord.</s><s id="section6sent4">But it is Hagar who is taught by the angel monitor,</s><s id="section6sent5">whose goodwill to her makes him at once her friend and counsellor, not to feel only shame, but to be of good courage as well; pointing out that shame apart from confidence is but a half virtue.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">The ensuing argument will bring to light the</s><s id="section7sent2">more subtle traits of shame.</s><s id="section7sent3">I must now go back to the heads suggested, and must begin with those who run away because of hatred.</s><s id="section7sent4">We are told that “Jacob kept Laban the Syrian in the dark, so as not to tell him that he is fleeing, and he fled, himself and all that belonged to him” (Gen. xxxi.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">20 f.).</s><s id="section8sent2">What,</s><s id="section8sent3">then, was the cause of the hatred?</s><s id="section8sent4">You would like perhaps to be told this.</s><s id="section8sent5">There are people who fashion their God out of substance devoid of quality or form or shape</s><s id="section8sent6">; but the moving Cause they neither know, nor have taken any trouble to learn from those who do know Him.</s><s id="section8sent7">They have neither mastered nor do they study the fairest subject of all, the first, nay the only one, whose knowledge it was a vital matter for them to acquire.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">Laban is of this class; for the</s><s id="section9sent2">sacred oracles assign to him the flock that is without mark (Gen. xxx. 42); and in the universe it is the matter devoid of quality and in men the ignorant and untutored soul that is without mark.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">Others there</s><s id="section10sent2">are of the better part, who said that Mind came and ordered all things,</s><s id="section10sent3">bringing the disorder that prevailed in existing things as the result of mob-rule into the order of regular government under a king.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Of this company Jacob is a votary, who is in charge of the variegated flock, marked and distinguished; and in the universe it is form that has variety and distinction, while among men it is the understanding, well-trained and loving to learn.</s><s id="section11sent2">The man of mark, associate of true monarchy, has</s><s id="section11sent3">imbibed in full measure the inbred spirit of fellowship, and comes to the man of no mark, when he fashions, as I said before, material sovereignties as</s><s id="section11sent4">Divine, and holds no sovereignty outside of these to be efficient,—comes to him to teach him that he is mistaken.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">For the world has come into being, and</s><s id="section12sent2">assuredly it has done so under the hand of some Cause; and the Word of Him who makes it is Himself the seal, by which each thing that exists has received its shape.</s><s id="section12sent3">Accordingly from the outset form in perfection accompanies the things that come into being, for it is an impress and image of the perfect Word.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">For the living creature that has come</s><s id="section13sent2">into being is imperfect in quantity, as is shewn by its constant growth as its age advances, but perfect in quality; for the same quality continues, inasmuch as it is the impress of a Divine Word ever continuing and free from every kind of change.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Jacob, seeing that Laban has grown deaf to instruction or lawful authority, naturally plans to run away, fearing lest, besides being unable to help, he should suffer harm at his hands.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">For association with men devoid of sense is hurtful, and the soul often involuntarily takes the impressions of their mad folly; and in the nature of things culture feels a repugnance towards lack of culture, and painstaking towards carelessness.</s><s id="section15sent2">And so the faculties of the</s><s id="section15sent3">Practiser lift their voice aloud, proclaiming</s><s id="section15sent4">their grounds for hatred: “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?</s><s id="section15sent5">Are we not counted of him strangers?</s><s id="section15sent6">For he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.</s><s id="section15sent7">All the riches and the glory, which God took away from our father, shall be for us and for our children” (Gen. xxxi.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">14–16).</s><s id="section16sent2">For being free both in names</s><s id="section16sent3">and in sentiments,</s><s id="section16sent4">they deem no senseless man to be rich or glorious, but all such, speaking broadly, to be poor and inglorious, even if they surpass in fortune wealthy kings.</s><s id="section16sent5">For they do not say that they will have their father’s wealth, but that which was taken away from their father, nor his glory, but the glory that was taken away from him.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">The worthless man is destitute</s><s id="section17sent2">of the real riches and the true gloriousness; for these good things are won by sound sense and self-mastery and the dispositions akin to these, which are the inheritance of virtue-loving souls.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Accordingly it is not</s><s id="section18sent2">the things that pertain to the good-for-nothing man, but those of which he has been stripped, that are affluence and renown to the worthy.</s><s id="section18sent3">Virtues are what has been stripped from him, and has become the property of the worthy, thus bringing into harmony what is said elsewhere: “we will sacrifice the abominations of Egypt to the Lord our God” (Exod. viii. 26); for victims perfect and free from blemish are the virtues and virtuous conduct, and these the Egyptian body, in its devotion to the passions, abominates.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">For even as in this passage, understood in</s><s id="section19sent2">accordance with reality, things which Egyptians reckon profane are called sacred in the estimation of the keen-sighted, and are all offered in sacrifice; exactly in the same way, the things of which every foolish man has been deprived and stripped, these the comrade of nobility of character will inherit.</s><s id="section19sent3">And these are real glory, indistinguishable from knowledge, and wealth, not the blind wealth, but that which has the keenest sight for the things that actually are, which accepts no counterfeit coinage, nay nothing whatever that is soulless, even though it be approved coin.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Right fitly, therefore, will Jacob run away from the</s><s id="section20sent2">man who has no part in the good things of God, the man who, even in finding fault with another, impugns himself without knowing it when he says, “If thou hadst told me, I would have sent thee forth” (Gen. xxxi. 27).</s><s id="section20sent3">For this alone would have been a sufficient ground for flight, if, when you were the slave of ten thousand masters, you assumed the style of dominion and lordship and proclaimed liberty to others.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">I however,</s><s id="section21sent2">says Jacob, took no man to help me to find the way that leads to virtue, but paid heed to Divine oracles bidding me depart hence, and to this moment they guide my steps.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">And how wouldst thou have</s><s id="section22sent2">sent me forth?</s><s id="section22sent3">Would it have been, as thou didst grandiloquently recount, “with merriment“that caused me pain, and “music” all unmusical, and “drums” noises inarticulate and meaningless, inflicting blows on the soul through the ears, “and with cithara” (ibid.), not instruments but modes of conduct void of melody or harmony?</s><s id="section22sent4">Nay, these are the very things that made me plan flight; but you, it seems, devised them as means of diverting me back from flight, to induce me to retrace my steps for the sake of the power to cheat and mislead inbred in those senses which I had with difficulty gained strength to tread underfoot.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">Hatred, then, was the cause of the flight that</s><s id="section23sent2">has been spoken of, but fear of that of which I am about to speak.</s><s id="section23sent3">For we read as follows: “Rebecca said to Jacob, ‘Lo, Esau thy brother threatens to kill thee.</s><s id="section23sent4">Now therefore, child, listen to my voice and arise and flee to Laban my brother to Haran, and live with him for some days, until the wrath and</s><s id="section23sent5">anger of thy brother turn away, and he forget the things which thou hast done to him: and I will send and fetch thee thence’</s><s id="section23sent6">“(Gen. xxvii. 42–45).</s><s id="section23sent7">For</s></p></div><div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">there is reason to fear lest the worse part of the soul set an ambush and lie in wait, or even openly arm, and then overthrow and cast down the better part.</s><s id="section24sent2">And this is excellent advice given by Rebecca, that is, by judicious Patience.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">Whenever, she says, you</s><s id="section25sent2">see the base one flowing in full current against virtue, and taking much account of things which it ought to disregard, of wealth, fame, pleasure, when he extols injustice as the author of each of these, and points out that it is mostly wrongdoers who attain to fame and to abundance of gold and silver, do not take at once the opposite direction, and practise penury and humility and a strict and unsocial mode of life;</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">for in this way you will rouse your adversary’s spirit and stimulate</s><s id="section26sent2">a more dangerous foe to the contest against you.</s><s id="section26sent3">Consider,</s><s id="section26sent4">then, by what course of action you are to escape his machinations.</s><s id="section26sent5">Adapt yourself, not to his pursuits and practices, but to the objects which serve to create them</s><s id="section26sent6">—honours, offices, silver, gold, possessions, different forms and colours, beautiful objects.</s><s id="section26sent7">And whenever you meet with these, do as a good artist does, and engrave upon the material substances a form as good as possible, and thus accomplish a work which may win men’s praise.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">You know well how, when</s><s id="section27sent2">an unskilled man takes charge of a vessel that is quite capable of making a safe voyage, he upsets it, whereas a skilled helmsman often saves one which</s><s id="section27sent3">is sinking; and how sick folk, under the care of inexperienced attendants, fall into a dangerous condition of body, while those who meet with experienced attendants recover even from angerous diseases.</s><s id="section27sent4">I need not labour the point.</s><s id="section27sent5">It is invariably the case that what is done with skill shews up and convicts what is done without it, and true praise accorded to the one is sure condemnation of the other.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">If, then, you desire</s><s id="section28sent2">thoroughly to expose the worthless man of wealth, do not refuse abundance of wealth.</s><s id="section28sent3">He, miserable creature, will be seen in his true colours, either with the instincts of a slave rather than a gentleman, a skinflint and a splitpenny; or on the other hand as living in a whirl of prodigality, ever ready to fling away money and to guzzle—an ever-active patron of courtesans, pimps, panders, and every licentious crew.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">You will contribute freely to needy friends,</s><s id="section29sent2">will make bountiful gifts to serve your country’s wants, you will help parents without means to marry their daughters, and provide them with an ample dowry;</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">you will all but throw your private property into the common stock and invite all deserving of kindness to take a share.</s><s id="section30sent2">In exactly the</s><s id="section30sent3">same way, when someone is crazy after fame and full of boastfulness, if you wish to cast reproach on the sorry fellow, do not turn your back upon popular applause if you have an opportunity of winning honour, and then, while the poor braggart strides conceitedly along, you will send him tumbling.</s><s id="section30sent4">While he will misuse his distinguished position to insult and disgrace others better than himself, and will exalt worse men above them, you on the other hand will make all worthy men sharers in the advantages</s><s id="section30sent5">of your good name, securing the position of the better kind, and improving the worse by your counsel.</s><s id="section30sent6">Again, if you go to a luxurious</s></p></div><div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">repast where the wine flow’s freely, go without hesitation; for you will put the intemperate man to shame by having yourself well in hand.</s><s id="section31sent2">He will fall upon his belly and open his insatiable appetites before he opens his mouth, cram himself in unseemly fashion, grab at his next neighbour’s food, and gobble up everything without a blush; and when he is thoroughly sated with eating, he will as the poets say “drink with a yawning maw,”</s><s id="section31sent3">and incur the mocking and ridicule of all who see him.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">But you,</s><s id="section32sent2">when there is no compulsion, will drink in moderation; and should you be forced in any case to indulge more freely, you will place the compulsion under the charge of reason, and never debase pleasure to the displeasure of others, but, if we may so speak, get soberly drunken.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Truth would therefore</s><s id="section33sent2">rightly find fault with those who without full consideration give up the business and financial side of a citizen’s life, and say that they have conceived a contempt for fame and pleasure.</s><s id="section33sent3">For they do not despise these things, they are practising an imposture.</s><s id="section33sent4">Their dirty bodies and gloomy faces, the rigour and squalour of their pinched life, are so many baits to lead others to regard them as lovers of orderliness and temperance and endurance.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">But they are</s><s id="section34sent2">unable to deceive the more sharp-sighted, who peer inside and refuse to be taken in by what meets the eye.</s><s id="section34sent3">For they thrust this back as mere screening</s><s id="section34sent4">of quite different things, and get a view of the true nature of the things concealed within, which, if they are beautiful, they admire, but if ugly, ridicule and loathe them for their hypocrisy.</s><s id="section34sent5">To such</s></p></div><div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">men, then, let us say:</s><s id="section35sent2">Do you affect the life that eschews social intercourse with others, and courts solitary loneliness?</s><s id="section35sent3">Well, what proof did you ever give before this of noble social qualities?</s><s id="section35sent4">Do you renounce money-making?</s><s id="section35sent5">When engaged in business, were you determined to be just in your dealings?</s><s id="section35sent6">Would you make a show of paying no regard to the pleasures of the belly and the parts below it—say, when you had abundant material for indulging in these, did you exercise moderation?</s><s id="section35sent7">Do you despise popular esteem?</s><s id="section35sent8">Well, when you held posts of honour, did you practise simplicity?</s><s id="section35sent9">State business is an object of ridicule to you people.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Perhaps you have never discovered how serviceable a thing it is.</s><s id="section36sent2">Begin, then, by getting some exercise</s><s id="section36sent3">and practice in the business of life both private and public; and when by means of the sister virtues, household-management and statesmanship, you have become masters in each domain, enter now, as more than qualified to do so, on your migration to a different and more excellent way of life.</s><s id="section36sent4">For the practical comes before the contemplative life; it is a sort of prelude to a more advanced contest; and it is well to have fought it out first.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">By taking this course you will avoid the imputation of shrinking from it through sheer laziness.</s><s id="section37sent2">It was</s><s id="section37sent3">on this principle too that the Levites were charged to perform their active service until the age of fifty (Numb. iv. 3 ff.), but, when released from their practical ministry, to make everything an object of</s><s id="section37sent4">observation and contemplation;</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">receiving as a prize for duty well done in the active life a quite different way of life whose delight is in knowledge and study of principles alone.</s><s id="section38sent2">And apart from this,</s><s id="section38sent3">it is a vital matter that those who venture to make the claims of God their aim and study should first have fully met those of men; for it is sheer folly to suppose that you will reach the greater while you are incapable of mastering the lesser.</s><s id="section38sent4">Therefore first make yourselves familiar with virtue as exercised in our dealings with men, to the end that you may be introduced to that also which has to do with our relation to God.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">Such is the substance of the advice which</s><s id="section39sent2">Patience gives to the Man of Practice, but the actual words need detailed treatment.</s><s id="section39sent3">“Behold,” she says, “Esau thy brother is threatening thee.”</s><s id="section39sent4">Is it not the case that the character which is hard and wooden, whose ignorance makes it disobedient, the character called “Esau,” nurses a grudge, and, offering the baits of this mortal life to destroy thee, money, fame, pleasures, and the like, is bent on killing thee?</s><s id="section39sent5">“But do thou, my child, flee from the present contest: for not yet has thy strength reached its full development, but, as is natural in a boy, the sinews of thy soul lack firmness.”</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">This is why she addressed</s><s id="section40sent2">him as “child,” a title at the same time expressive of kindly feeling and suited to a tender age; for we regard the character of the Practiser both as young compared with the fully developed and as lovable.</s><s id="section40sent3">Such a one is quite capable of winning the prizes that are offered to boys, but is not as yet able to carry off those offered to men; and the best prize that men can obtain, is to minister to the only God.</s></p></div>
