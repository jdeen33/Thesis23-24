On Dreams
<div id="Book-1" n="1" subtype="book" type="textpart">
Book I
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section1sent1">The treatise before this one embraced that firstclass of heaven-sent dreams, in which, as we said, the Deity of His own motion sends to us the visions which are presented to us in sleep.</s><s id="Book0section1sent2">In the present treatise we shall, to the best of our ability, bring before our readers dreams which find their right place under our second head.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section2sent1">The second kind of dreams is that inwhich our own mind, moving out of itself together with the Mind of the Universe, seems to be possessed and God-inspired, and so capable of receiving some foretaste and foreknowledge of things to come.</s><s id="Book0section2sent2">The first dream belonging to the class thus indicated is that which appeared to the dreamer on the stairway of Heave:</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section3sent1">“And he dreamed, andbehold a stairway set up on the earth, of which the top reached to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending upon it.</s><s id="Book0section3sent2">And the Lord stood firmly on it; and He said, ‘I am the God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac; fear not; the land whereon thou sleepest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the sand of the earth, and shall spread abroadto the west and the south and the north and the east; and in thee shall be blessed all the tribes of the earth, and in thy seed.</s><s id="Book0section3sent3">And, behold, I am with thee, guarding thee in every way by which thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land, for I will by no means forsake thee, until I have done all things whatsoever I have spoken unto thee’” (Gen. xxviii.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section4sent1">12–15).</s><s id="Book0section4sent2">The vision is introducedby a prefatory passage necessary for its understanding,
and if we study this in detail we shall perhaps be able easily to grasp the meaning of the vision.</s><s id="Book0section4sent3">What then is this prefatory passage?</s><s id="Book0section4sent4">It runs thus: “And Jacob went out from the Well of the Oath, and made his journey to Haran; and he met with a place; for the sun set; and he took one from the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and he slept in that place” (ibid. 10 f.); and then at once follows the dream.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section5sent1">It is worth while, then, at theoutset to investigate these three points, firstly, what “the Well of the Oath” is and why it was so called; secondly, what “Haran” is, and why it is that on coming out from the Well aforesaid he comes at onceto Haran; thirdly, what “the place” is, and why, when he reaches it, the sun sets, and he himself goes to sleep.</s><s id="Book0section5sent2">Let us consider the first to begin with.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section6sent1">To me,then, the Well seems to be a symbol of knowledge; for the nature of knowledge is to be very deep, not superficial; it does not display itself openly, but loves to hide itself in secrecy; it is discovered not easily but with difficulty and with much labour.</s><s id="Book0section6sent2">And allthis may be seen not only in branches of knowledge
which contain a whole multitude of important problems, but in the simpleststudies as well.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section7sent1">Justchoose any art you please, not the best of them I beg of you, but the most ignoble of them all, which perhaps no free man whatever brought up in a city would voluntarily practise, and even in the country
a servant who has to grapple with a harsh and
ill-conditioned master, who forces him to many a
distasteful task, would only undertake reluctantly.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section8sent1">For it will be found to be not a simple but a subtlematter, one “which needs both hands to take it,”
hard to discover and hard to master, a foe to
hesitation and negligence and indifference, demanding abundance of zest and enthusiasm, of hard toil and anxious thought.</s><s id="Book0section8sent2">This is why the diggers
of this well say that they found no water in it (Gen. xxvi. 32),inasmuch as the ends pursued in the different branches of knowledge prove to be not only hard to reach, but absolutely beyond finding.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section9sent1">That is whyone man is a better scholar or geometrician than another, because no limit can be set to the extensions and enlargements of his subject in all directions.</s><s id="Book0section9sent2">For what still remains is always waiting to engage us in fuller force than what we have already learned; so that the man who is supposed to have reached the very end of knowledge, is considered in the
judgement of another to have come half way; while if Truth give her verdict, he is pronounced to be just beginning.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section10sent1">For “life is short,” said one, “and artis long”; and he best apprehends its greatnesswho honestly sounds its depths, and digs it like a well.</s><s id="Book0section10sent2">So there is a story that a grey-haired
man of great age shed tears when dying, not in any cowardly fear of death, but by reason of his yearning for education, and the thought that he is now first entering upon it, when he takes his final leave of it.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section11sent1">For the soul is just blossoming into knowledge,when the body’s bloom is withering away through the passing of years.</s><s id="Book0section11sent2">So it is a hard fate to be tripped up by the heels before one has attained the prime of youthful strength to apprehend things more accurately.</s><s id="Book0section11sent3">This experience is common to all who love to learn, who see new results of thought and study rise like a shining light in addition to the old.</s><s id="Book0section11sent4">Many of these does the soul, if it be not cursed with barrenness,
bring forth; many does Nature of herself shew to those whose understanding is sharp-sighted, without
giving any sign beforehand of their coming.</s><s id="Book0section11sent5">So then the well of knowledge, the well without limit or ending, has been shewn to be such as I have described.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section12sent1">Why it was named “Oath” I must nowtell you.</s><s id="Book0section12sent2">Matters that are in doubt are decided by an oath, insecure things made secure, assurance given to that which lacked it.</s><s id="Book0section12sent3">From this we conclude that there is nothing which can be asserted withgreater certainty than that wisdom is essentially without end or limit.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section13sent1">While then it is well to agree with one whodiscourses on these truths even if he takes no oath, let anyone who is not very prone to assent do so when the speaker is on his oath.</s><s id="Book0section13sent2">And no one need shrink from taking such an oath, for he may rest assured thathis name will appear on the register of those who have sworn truly.</s><s id="Book0section13sent3">Enough on these points.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section14sent1">The next thing toinquire is why, when four wells are dug by Abraham and Isaac and those about them (Gen. xxi. 25, xxvi. 19–23), the fourth and last received as its name “Oath.” Probably Moses wishes to shew us</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section15sent1">Allegoricallythat while both the constituents of which the universe is composed, and those from which we ourselves were moulded and so fashioned into human shape, are four in number, three of them are such as can in one way or another be apprehended, but the fourth is universally held to be beyond our powers of apprehension.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section16sent1">In the world, then, we find theconstituents that make up the whole to be four, earth, water, air, heaven.</s><s id="Book0section16sent2">To three of these properties have been allotted, the discovery of which may be difficult, but is not wholly impossible.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section17sent1">For, asregards earth, we perceive that it is a body, heavy, indissoluble, firm, cut up into mountain-ranges and level plains, divided by rivers and sea, so that parts of it are islands, part continents; that some of it has a light thin soil, some of it a deep soil; some of it rough, stiff, stony, and altogether barren, some level and soft and very fertile.</s><s id="Book0section17sent2">These and a thousand other points we apprehend.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section18sent1">As to wateragain, we perceive that it has several of the properties just enumerated in common with land, and others peculiar to itself; for some of it is sweet, some brackish, other parts marked by other differences; some water is fit to drink, other water unfit.</s><s id="Book0section18sent2">We know too it has not either of these properties alike for all; one kind of water is drinkable by some but not by others, and what is undrinkable by some isquite drinkable by others; and that some is by nature cold, some by nature hot:</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section19sent1">for there are athousand springs, in many places giving forth boiling water, and that not only on land, but in the sea.</s><s id="Book0section19sent2">Yes, there have before now appeared veins emitting boiling water in mid ocean, which all the force of the surrounding seas pouring over them from time
immemorial has been powerless to quench or even in any measure to check.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section20sent1">Again we perceive that theair has a nature which gives way to the pressure of the objects around it; that it is the instrument of life, of breathing, of sight, hearing and the other senses; that it admits of density and rarity, of motion and stillness, that it undergoes all kinds of change; that it is the source of winter and summer, and of the autumn and spring seasons, that is, of the constituent parts that fix the limits of the year’s cycle.</s><s id="Book0section20sent2">All these we perceive;</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section21sent1">but heaven has sentto us no sure indication of its nature, but keeps it beyond our comprehension.</s><s id="Book0section21sent2">For what can we say?</s><s id="Book0section21sent3">That it is a fixed mass of crystal, as some have thought?</s><s id="Book0section21sent4">Or that it is absolutely pure fire?</s><s id="Book0section21sent5">Or that it is a fifth substance, circular in movement, with no part in the four elements?</s><s id="Book0section21sent6">Again, we ask, has the fixed and outmost sphere upward-reaching depth, or is it nothing but a superficies, without depth, resembling plane geometrical figures?</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section22sent1">Again: arethe stars lumps of earth full of fire?</s><s id="Book0section22sent2">Some peoplehave declared them to be dells and glades and masses of fiery metal, for which they themselves deserve a prison and mill-house, in which such instruments are kept to punish impiety.</s><s id="Book0section22sent3">Or are the stars an unbroken,
and, as one has said, “close” harmony, indissoluble
compresses of ether?</s><s id="Book0section22sent4">Are they living and intelligent, or devoid of intelligence and conscious life?</s><s id="Book0section22sent5">Are their motions determined by choice or simply by necessity?</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section23sent1">Does the moon contribute alight of its own or a borrowed light caused by the rays of the sun shining on it?</s><s id="Book0section23sent2">Or is it neither the one nor the other by itself absolutely, but the combined
result of both, a mixture such as we might expect from a fire partly its own, partly borrowed?</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section24sent1">Yes, all these and suchlike points pertaining to heaven, that fourth and best cosmic substance, are obscure and beyond our apprehension, based on guess-work and conjecture, not on the solid reasoning of truth; so much so that one may confidently takeone’s oath that the day will never come when any mortal shall be competent to arrive at a clear solution of any of these problems.</s><s id="Book0section24sent2">This is why the fourth and waterless well was named “Oath,” being the endless and altogether baffling quest of the fourth cosmic region, heaven.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section25sent1">Let us see in what way that which occupies thefourth place in ourselves too is of such a nature as to be eminently and peculiarly incomprehensible.</s><s id="Book0section25sent2">The factors in us of highest significance are four, body, sense-perception, speech, mind.</s><s id="Book0section25sent3">Three of these arenot obscure in all their aspects, but contain in
themselves some indications by which they can be
understood.</s><s id="Book0section25sent4">What do I mean?</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section26sent1">We know that the bodyis threefold in dimensions and sixfold in movements, having three dimensions, length, depth, breadth, and twice as many, namely six, movements, upward, downward, to the right, to the left, forward, backward.</s><s id="Book0section26sent2">Nor are we ignorant that it is a vessel for the soul, and we are perfectly aware that it comes to maturity, wears out, grows old, dies, is dissolved.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section27sent1">With respect to sense-perception, also,we are not wholly dim-sighted, and blind, but we are able to say that it is divided into five parts, and that each part has its special organs fashioned by Nature, eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, nostrils for smelling, and for the others the organs in which they find their fit place,and that they are understanding’s messengers,
bringing to it reports of colours, forms, sounds, distinct scents and savours, in a word, of material substances and their qualities, and that they are bodyguards of the soul, making known all that they have seen or heard.</s><s id="Book0section27sent2">And should any hurtful thing approach from without, they are aware of it beforehand,
and on their guard against it, lest it should stealthily make its way in and cause incurable damage to their mistress.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section28sent1">Sound, too, does notentirely elude our discernment.</s><s id="Book0section28sent2">We know that one sound is shrill, another deep, one tuneful and melodious,
another discordant and most unmusical, and again, one louder and another softer.</s><s id="Book0section28sent3">They differ also in countless other respects, in genera, tone colours, intervals, conjunct or disjunct systems, and harmoniesof the fourth, the fifth, the octave.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section29sent1">In articulate sound, moreover, an advantage possessedby man alone of all living creatures, there are particulars of which we are aware; as, for example, that it is sent up from the understanding, that it is in the mouth that it acquires articulation, that it is the beat or stroke of the tongue that imparts articulation and speech to the tension of the voice, but does not produce
simply just an idle sound and unshapen noise, since it holds to the suggesting mind the office of its herald and interpreter.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section30sent1">Is, then, the fourth element in ourselves, thedominant mind, capable of being comprehended?</s><s id="Book0section30sent2">By no means.</s><s id="Book0section30sent3">For what do we suppose it to be essentially?</s><s id="Book0section30sent4">Breath or blood or body in general?</s><s id="Book0section30sent5">Nay, we must pronounce it no body but incorporeal.</s><s id="Book0section30sent6">Do we regard it as boundary-line, or form, or number, or continuity, or harmony, or what amongst all that exists?</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section31sent1">At our birth is it at once introduced into usfrom without?</s><s id="Book0section31sent2">Or does the air which envelops it impart intense hardness to the warm nature within us, such as the red-hot iron receives when plunged at the smithy into cold water?</s><s id="Book0section31sent3">The name of “soul” would
seem to have been given to it owing to the “cooling” which it thus undergoes.</s><s id="Book0section31sent4">Again: when we die, is it quenched and does it share the decay of our bodies, or live on for a considerable time, or is it wholly imperishable?</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section32sent1">And where in the bodyhas the mind made its lair?</s><s id="Book0section32sent2">Has it had a dwelling assigned to it?</s><s id="Book0section32sent3">Some have regarded the head, our body’s citadel, as its hallowed shrine, since it is aboutthe head that the senses have their station, and it seems natural to them that they should be posted there, like bodyguards to some mighty monarch.</s><s id="Book0section32sent4">Others contend pertinaciously for their conviction that the heart is the shrine in which it is carried.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section33sent1">Soin every case it is the fourth of the series that is beyond comprehension.</s><s id="Book0section33sent2">In the universe it is the heaven in contrast with the nature of air and earth and water; in man it is mind over against the body, and sense-preception, and the speech which gives expression to thought.</s><s id="Book0section33sent3">It may well be
that it is for this reason that the fourth year is
designated in the sacred documents “holy and for praise” (Lev. xix.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section34sent1">24); for among created things, that whichis holy is, in the universe, the heavens, in which natures imperishable and enduring through long ages have their orbits; in man it is mind, a fragment of the Deity, as the words of Moses in particular bear witness, “He breathed into his face a breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Gen. ii.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section35sent1">7). Andeach of these appears to me to be correctly spoken of as “for praise.</s><s id="Book0section35sent2">”For it is in the heaven and in the mind that capacity resides to set forth in solemn strains hymns of praise and blessing in honour of the Father who is the author of our being.</s><s id="Book0section35sent3">For man is the recipient of a privilege which gives him distinction
beyond other living creatures, that, namely, of worshipping Him that Is;</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section36sent1">while the heaven is ever melodious, producing, as the heavenly bodies gothrough their movements, the full and perfect harmony.</s><s id="Book0section36sent2">If the sound of it ever reached our ears, there would be produced irrepressible yearnings, frantic longings, wild ceaseless passionate desires, compelling to abstain even from necessary food, for no longershould we take in nourishment from meat and drink through the throat after the fashion of mortals, but, as beings awaiting immortality, from inspired strains of perfect melody coming to us through our ears.</s><s id="Book0section36sent3">To such strains it is said that Moses was listening, when, having laid aside his body, for forty days and as many nights he touched neither bread nor water at all (Ex. xxiv. 18).</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section37sent1">It seems, then, that theheaven, the original archetype of all musical instruments,
was tuned with consummate skill for no other purpose than that the hymns sung in honour of the Universal Father may have a musical accompaniment.</s><s id="Book0section37sent2">And further we hear of Leah or Virtue being no longer capable of bearing children after the birth of her fourth son.</s><s id="Book0section37sent3">She stayed, or rather was stayed, from childbirth, for she found, I imagine, all giving birth on her part dried up and unproductive, when she had put forth the bloom of “Judah,” or Confession of thankfulness, which is the perfect fruit.</s></p></div><div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section38sent1">To say that she “stood still from bearing” (Gen.xxix. 35) differs not at all from saying that the servants
of Isaac found no water in the fourth well (Gen. xxvi. 32), since what is brought out by each of the figures is that all things are athirst for God, through Whom the birth of things, and their food when born, is watered into fruitfulness.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section39sent1">It may bethat men of narrow citizenship will suppose that the lawgiver delivers this very full discourse about digging wells, but those who are on the roll of a greater country, even this whole world, men of higher thought and feeling, will be quite sure that the four things propounded as a subject of inquiry to the open-eyed lovers of contemplation are not four wells, but the four parts of this universe, land, water, air, heavens.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section40sent1">On each of these they bring to bear powers ofthought of finest perfection, and find in three of them certain things within their comprehension, and to these discoveries of theirs they give three names, “injustice,” “enmity,” “spaciousness”(Gen. xxvi. 20 ff.).</s><s id="Book0section40sent2">In the fourth, the heavens, as we pointed out not long ago, they find nothing whatever comprehensible.</s><s id="Book0section40sent3">For the fourth well is found to be dry and waterless, and is entitled “oath” for the reason which has been mentioned.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section41sent1">Let us now examine the following context,and inquire what Haran is and why one who goes away from the well comes to it (Gen. xxviii. 10).</s><s id="Book0section41sent2">Haran is, then, as it seems to me, a sort of mother-city
of the senses.</s><s id="Book0section41sent3">For it is rendered sometimes “dug,” sometimes “holes,” one thing being signified by both words.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book0section42sent1">For our body has after a fashionbeen dug out to make places for the organs of the senses, and each of the organs has been constituted a kind of “dug-out” of each sense, which nature provides
for its lair.</s><s id="Book0section42sent2">Whenever, therefore, a man has put out from the well which is called “Oath,” as it were from a port, of necessity he forthwith arrivesat Haran.</s><s id="Book0section42sent3">For the man who sets forth on a journey from the place of knowledge, boundless and illimitable
in its vastness, needs no escorting guides, but is without fail received by the senses.</s></p></div>
