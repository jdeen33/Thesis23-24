On the Eternity of the World
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">In dealing with every obscure and weighty</s><s id="section1sent2">question it is well to call upon God, because</s><s id="section1sent3">He is good, because He is the Creator, and possessed as He is of absolutely exact knowledge of all things nothing is obscure to Him.</s><s id="section1sent4">But it is particularly necessary when the subject in question is the indestructibility of the world.</s><s id="section1sent5">For nothing in the realm of the sensible is more complete in every way than the world, nothing in the intelligible realm more perfect than God, and intelligence always takes command of sense and the intelligible of the sensible.</s><s id="section1sent6">And those in whom the love of truth is implanted in greater measure observe the law that knowledge about the subjects must be sought from the Commander and Ruler.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">Now, if schooled in the doctrines</s><s id="section2sent2">of wisdom and temperance and every virtue we had scoured away the stains of the passions and soul-distempers,
perhaps God would not have refused to impart the knowledge of things heavenly through dreams or oracles or signs or wonders to souls thoroughly purged and bright and radiant.</s><s id="section2sent3">But since we bear upon us deep ingrained the imprints</s><s id="section2sent4">of injustice and folly and the other vices we must be content if through a study of probabilities and by our own efforts we may discover some semblance of the truth.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">Now the words “world” and “destruction” are</s><s id="section3sent2">both such as are used in many senses and therefore it will be well to open the discussion whether the world is indestructible by examining these terms in order to distinguish under what signification they stand in this case.</s><s id="section3sent3">Still we need not make a complete list of all the meanings they bear but only such as are instructive for our present purpose.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">In one sense, the world or Cosmos signifies the</s><s id="section4sent2">whole system of heaven and the stars including the earth and the plants and animals thereon; in another sense the heaven only.</s><s id="section4sent3">It was on heaven that Anaxagoras had been gazing, when in answer to the person who asked why he suffered discomfort by spending the whole night under the open sky said he did it in order to contemplate the Cosmos, meaning by Cosmos the choric movements and revolutions of the stars.</s><s id="section4sent4">The third sense, which is approved by the Stoics, is something existing continuously to and through the general conflagration,</s><s id="section4sent5">a substance either</s><s id="section4sent6">reduced or not reduced to order, and time, they say, is what measures its movement.</s><s id="section4sent7">Our
present discussion is concerned with the world in the first sense, namely the world which consists of heaven and earth and the life on them.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">The word destruction</s><s id="section5sent2">in one sense means a change for the worse, in another complete removal from existence, and this we must pronounce to be a thing which cannot possibly be, for just as nothing comes into being out of the nonexistent, so nothing is destroyed into non-existence.</s><s id="section5sent3">Nothing from what is not can come to be,
Nor was it ever heard or brought to pass,
That what exists should perish utterly.</s><s id="section5sent4">So too the tragic poet</s><s id="section5sent5">Naught that is born can die;
Hither and thither its parts disperse</s><s id="section5sent6">And take another form.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Nothing in fact is so foolish as to raise the question</s><s id="section6sent2">whether the world is destroyed into non-existence.</s><s id="section6sent3">The point is whether it undergoes a transmutation from its ordered arrangement through the various forms of the elements and their combinations being either resolved into one and the self-same conformation or reduced into complete confusion as things are when broken or shattered.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">Three views have been put forward on the</s><s id="section7sent2">question before us.</s><s id="section7sent3">Some assert that the world is eternal, uncreated and imperishable.</s><s id="section7sent4">Some on the contrary say that it is created and destructible.</s><s id="section7sent5">Others draw from both these.</s><s id="section7sent6">From the latter they take the idea of the created, from the former that of the indestructible and so have laid down a composite doctrine to the effect that the world is created and indestructible.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">Democritus with Epicurus</s><s id="section8sent2">and the great mass of Stoic philosophers maintain the creation and destruction of the world but in different ways.</s><s id="section8sent3">The two first named postulate many worlds, the origin of which they ascribe to the mutual impacts and interlacings of atoms and its destruction to the counterblows and collisions sustained by the bodies so formed.</s><s id="section8sent4">The Stoics admit one world only;</s><s id="section8sent5">God is the cause of its creation but not of its destruction.</s><s id="section8sent6">This is due to the force of the ever-active fire which exists in things and in the course of long cycles of time resolves everything into itself and out of it is constructed a reborn world according to the design of its architect.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">According</s><s id="section9sent2">to these the world may be called from one point of view an eternal, from another a perishable world; thought of as a world reconstructed it is perishable, thought of as subject to the conflagration it is everlasting through the ceaseless rebirths and cycles which render it immortal.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">But Aristotle</s><s id="section10sent2">surely showed a pious and religious spirit when in opposition to this view he said that the world was uncreated and indestructible and denounced the shocking atheism of those who stated the contrary</s><s id="section10sent3">and held that there was no difference between handmade idols</s><s id="section10sent4">and that great visible God who embraces the sun and moon and the pantheon as it may be truly called of the fixed and wandering stars.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">He</s><s id="section11sent2">is reported to have said in bitter mockery that in the past he had feared for his house lest it should be overthrown by violent winds or terrific storms or lapse of time or neglect of proper care.</s><s id="section11sent3">But now he lived under the fear of a greater menace from the theorists who would destroy the whole world.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Some say that the author of this doctrine was not</s><s id="section12sent2">Aristotle but certain Pythagoreans, and I have read a work of Ocellus a Lucanian</s><s id="section12sent3">entitled</s><s id="section12sent4">On the Nature of the Universe, in which he not only stated but sought to establish by demonstrations that it was uncreated and indestructible.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">That it is created and indestructible is said to</s><s id="section13sent2">be shown by Plato in the Timaeus</s><s id="section13sent3">in his account of the great assembly of deities in which the younger gods are addressed thus by the eldest and chief.</s><s id="section13sent4">Gods sprung from gods, the works of which I am the Maker and Father are indissoluble unless I will otherwise.</s><s id="section13sent5">Now all that is bound can be loosed but only the bad would will to loose what is well put together and in good condition.</s><s id="section13sent6">So since you are created beings you are not immortal nor altogether indissoluble, yet you will not be dissolved nor will death be your fate, for in my will you have a greater and mightier bond than those by which you were</s><s id="section13sent7">bound when you were created.”</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Some hold the</s><s id="section14sent2">notion that when Plato speaks of the world as created he does not mean that it began by being created but that if it had been created it would not have been formed in any other way than that which he describes, or else that he uses the word because the parts of the world are observed to come into being and to be changed.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">But this subtlety of</s><s id="section15sent2">theirs is not so good or true an idea as the view before mentioned, not merely because throughout the whole treatise</s><s id="section15sent3">he speaks of the great Framer of deities as the Father and Maker and Artificer and this world as His work and offspring, a sensible copy of the archetypal and intelligible model, embracing in itself as objects of sense all which that model contains as objects of intelligence, an impress</s><s id="section15sent4">for sense perception as absolutely perfect as that is for the mind.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">Another reason is that this view of Plato’s meaning</s><s id="section16sent2">has the testimony of Aristotle, who had too much respect for philosophy to falsify anything.</s><s id="section16sent3">A teacher can have no more trustworthy witness than a disciple and particularly one like Aristotle who did not treat culture as a by-work or with frivolous carelessness, but sought earnestly to transcend the truths discovered by the ancients and so struck out a new</s><s id="section16sent4">path by discovering some very vital additions to every part of philosophy.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">Some think</s><s id="section17sent2">that the poet Hesiod is the father of this Platonic doctrine and suppose that he calls the world uncreated and indestructible, uncreated because he says</s><s id="section17sent3">First Chaos was, and then broad-breasted earth
Safe dwelling-place for all for evermore,</s><s id="section17sent4">indestructible because he never declared that it will be dissolved or destroyed.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Chaos in Aristotle’s</s><s id="section18sent2">opinion is a space because a body must have something there already to hold it,</s><s id="section18sent3">but some of the Stoics suppose that it is water and that the name is derived from its diffusion (χύσις).</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">But
whichever of these is right Hesiod very clearly states the view that the world is created and long before</s><s id="section19sent2">Hesiod Moses the lawgiver of the Jews said in the Holy Books that it was created and imperishable.</s><s id="section19sent3">These books are five in number, to the first of which he gave the name of Genesis.</s><s id="section19sent4">In this he begins by saying “In the beginning God made the Heavens and the Earth and the Earth was invisible and without form.”</s><s id="section19sent5">Then again he goes on to say in the sequel that “days and nights and seasons and years and the sun and moon whose natural function is to</s><s id="section19sent6">measure time are together with the whole heaven destined to immortality and continue indestructible.”</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Respect for that visible God requires that we</s><s id="section20sent2">should begin the discussion in the proper way by setting forth first the arguments which contend that it is uncreated and indestructible.</s><s id="section20sent3">All things which are liable to perish are subject to two fundamental sources of destruction, the external and the internal.</s><s id="section20sent4">Thus iron, brass and similar substances will be found to vanish of themselves when devoured by the rust which courses over them like a creeping sickness</s><s id="section20sent5">; and also through external agencies, when a house or city is burnt and they too are caught in the flames and dissolved through the violence of the rushing fire.</s><s id="section20sent6">Similarly, too, living creatures die of themselves through disease or through external causes, being slain with the sword or stoned or burnt or suffering the unclean death of hanging.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">Now if the world is</s><s id="section21sent2">destroyed it will necessarily be through either some force from without or some of those which it contains within itself, and both of these are impossible.</s><s id="section21sent3">For there is nothing outside the world since all things have been brought into contribution to fill it up, and</s><s id="section21sent4">filled it must be if it is to be one and a total and unaging: one because if some things are left out another world would come into being like the one that now is; total because all that exists is used up to make it; proof against age and disease because the bodies which fall a prey to diseases and old age succumb to the powerful onsets from outside of heat and cold and all other opposite extremes,</s><s id="section21sent5">and none of these forces can escape from the world to surround and attack it, for they are all in their entirety confined within it and no part of them stays away from it.</s><s id="section21sent6">And if there is anything outside it will necessarily be a void, the impassive form of existence which cannot be acted on or act.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">Neither again will anything</s><s id="section22sent2">internal cause its dissolution.</s><s id="section22sent3">First because if it did the part would be greater and stronger than the whole, which is against all reason.</s><s id="section22sent4">For the world while exerting a force which nothing can surpass propels all its parts and is propelled by none.</s><s id="section22sent5">Secondly because as the sources of destruction are twofold, one external and one internal, things which can be subject to one of these two must certainly be susceptible to the other.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">As a proof of this we see</s><s id="section23sent2">that an ox or a horse or a man or other similar creatures since they are liable to be killed by an iron weapon are also liable to die through disease.</s><s id="section23sent3">For it is difficult or rather impossible to find anything which if susceptible to destruction through an external cause is entirely proof against an internal.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">Since then it has been shown that the world will not</s><s id="section24sent2">be destroyed by anything external because nothing at all has been left outside, neither will anything within it cause its destruction as demonstrated by the argument stated above, namely that that which is liable to be destroyed by one of the causes must be susceptible to the other.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">In the</s><s id="section25sent2">Timaeus, too, we have the following testimony to show that the world is proof against disease and destruction in the future.</s><s id="section25sent3">“Now the framing of the world took up the whole of each of these four elements, for out of all fire, of all water and air and earth did the framer fashion it, leaving no part nor power of any without.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">Therein he had this intent, first that it might be a creature, perfect to the utmost</s><s id="section26sent2">with all its parts perfect, next that it might be one, seeing that nothing was left over by which another of the kind should be formed: furthermore, that it might be free from age and sickness, for he reflected that when hot things and cold and all such as have strong powers gather round a composite body from without and fall unseasonably upon it they annoy it and bringing upon it sickness and age cause it to decay.</s><s id="section26sent3">With this motive and on such reasons</s><s id="section26sent4">God fashioned it as a whole, with each of its parts whole in itself so as to be perfect, and free from age and sickness.”</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">We may take this as Plato’s testimony</s><s id="section27sent2">to the indestructibility of the world; that it is uncreated follows the natural law of consequences.</s><s id="section27sent3">Dissolution is consequential to the created, indestructibility to the uncreated.</s><s id="section27sent4">The author of the verse “All that is born is due to death”</s><s id="section27sent5">seems to</s><s id="section27sent6">have hit the truth and to have understood the causal connexion between birth and destruction.</s><s id="section27sent7">The matter is put otherwise thus.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">All compound</s><s id="section28sent2">things which are destroyed are dissolved into what they were compounded from.</s><s id="section28sent3">Dissolution then is found to be nothing else than a return to the natural condition of each, and therefore conversely composition has forced the ingredients thus collected into an unnatural condition.</s><s id="section28sent4">And indeed the absolute truth of this appears as follows.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">We men are</s><s id="section29sent2">an amalgamation out of the four elements which in their totality are elements of the universe, namely earth, water, air and fire, out of which we have borrowed only small pieces.</s><s id="section29sent3">But the pieces thus amalgamated have lost their natural position.</s><s id="section29sent4">Heat the upward soaring is thrust down and the earthy and weighty substance is lightened and has taken instead the upper position which is occupied by the most earthy of our constituents, the head.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">But the</s><s id="section30sent2">bond which violence has clinched is the most worthless of all bonds and lasts for but a little time.</s><s id="section30sent3">Quickly it is broken by the rebellious prisoners in their yearning for their natural free movement towards which they eagerly take their departure.</s><s id="section30sent4">As the tragic poet says</s><s id="section30sent5">What springs from earth goes back to earth,</s><s id="section30sent6">The ether-born to heaven’s vault returns;</s><s id="section30sent7">Naught that is born can die;
Hither and thither its parts disperse</s><s id="section30sent8">And take their proper form.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Now the law laid down to govern all things which</s><s id="section31sent2">are destroyed is this.</s><s id="section31sent3">When the assembled things are in the combined state of existence they have accepted conditions of disorder in exchange for their natural order and move away into positions opposite to the natural.</s><s id="section31sent4">So in a sense they seem to live like strangers in a foreign land.</s><s id="section31sent5">But when they are dissolved they return to the condition proper to their nature.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">But the world has</s><s id="section32sent2">nothing of the disorder which exists in the compounds of which we have been speaking.</s><s id="section32sent3">Observation will show that if it undergoes destruction its several parts must at present have been arranged in an unnatural position and such a supposition is irreverent.</s><s id="section32sent4">For all the parts of the world have been given the best possible situation and harmony of order, so that each is as it were in its beloved fatherland and does not seek any change for the better.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">And so the earth has been assigned the mid-most</s><s id="section33sent2">position to which all things of earth descend even if they are thrown up, a sign that this is their natural</s><s id="section33sent3">position, for if anything stands at rest anywhere without being forced thither it is there that it has found its proper place.</s><s id="section33sent4">Water is spread over the surface of earth, and air and fire have made their way from the middle to the upper position, air having allotted to it the space between water and fire and fire the uppermost.</s><s id="section33sent5">And so even if you light a torch and make it descend to earth the flame will all the same force its way against you and speed upwards lightening itself to gain the motion natural to fire.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">In fact if we grant that in other creatures destruction</s><s id="section34sent2">is caused by their unnatural arrangement of their parts, while in the world each of the parts is arranged naturally and has its proper position apportioned to it, we are justified in saying that the world is indestructible.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">Another point which must be clear to everyone is</s><s id="section35sent2">this.</s><s id="section35sent3">Nature in each case strives to maintain and conserve the thing of which it is the nature and if it were possible to render it immortal.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Tree nature acts so in trees, animal nature in each kind of animal, but the nature of any particular part is necessarily</s><s id="section36sent2">too. feeble to carry it into a perpetual existence.</s><s id="section36sent3">For privation or scorching or chilling or the vast multitude of other circumstances which ordinarily affect it descend to shake it violently and loosen and finally break the bond which holds it together, though if no such external force were lying ready to attack it, so far as itself was concerned, it would preserve all things small or great proof against age.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">The</s><s id="section37sent2">nature of the world then must necessarily desire the conservation of the All.</s><s id="section37sent3">For it is not inferior to</s><s id="section37sent4">the nature of particular parts that it should take to its heels and leave its post and try to manufacture sickness rather than health, destruction rather than complete preservation, since</s><s id="section37sent5">High o’er them all she rears her head and brows
Easy to recognize though all are fair.</s><s id="section37sent6">But if this is true the world will not be susceptible to destruction.</s><s id="section37sent7">Why so?</s><s id="section37sent8">Because the nature which holds it together fortified by its great fund of strength is invincible and prevails over everything which could injure it.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">And so Plato says well</s><s id="section38sent2">: “For nothing</s><s id="section38sent3">went out from it nor entered it from anywhere.</s><s id="section38sent4">For there was nothing.</s><s id="section38sent5">For by design it was created to supply its own sustenance by its own wasting</s><s id="section38sent6">and have all its actions and passions in itself and by itself.</s><s id="section38sent7">For its framer deemed that were it self-sufficing it would be far better than if it required aught else.”</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">There is another highly logical line of proof</s><s id="section39sent2">which thousands, I know, hail with pride as very exact and absolutely irrefutable.</s><s id="section39sent3">They ask what motive will God have for destroying the world.</s><s id="section39sent4">It must be either to cease from world-making or to construct another.</s></p></div>
