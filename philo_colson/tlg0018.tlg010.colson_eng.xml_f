Concerning Noah’s Work as a Planter
Book II
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">We have said in the former book all that the</s><s id="section1sent2">occasion called for regarding the husbandman’s art in general.</s><s id="section1sent3">In this book we shall give such an account as we can of the art of a vine-dresser in particular.</s><s id="section1sent4">For Moses introduces the righteous man not as a husbandman only, but specially as a vine-dresser; his words are: “Noah began to be a husbandman tilling the ground, and he planted a vineyard”
(Gen. ix.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">20).</s><s id="section2sent2">It is incumbent on one,</s><s id="section2sent3">who is going to discourse on the work of planters and husbandmen as carried on in this or that place, to begin by marking well the plants set in the universe, those most perfect of all plants, and their great Planter and Overseer.</s><s id="section2sent4">It is the Lord of all things that is the greatest of planters and most perfect Master of His art.</s><s id="section2sent5">It is this World that is a plant containing in itself the particular plants all at once in their myriads, like shoots springing from a single root.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">For, when the Framer of the World, finding</s><s id="section3sent2">all that existed confused and disordered of itself, began to give it form, by bringing it out of disorder into order, out of confusion into distinction of parts,</s><s id="section3sent3">He caused earth and water to occupy the position of</s><s id="section3sent4">roots at its centre; the trees, that are air and fire, He drew up from the centre to the space on high; the encircling region of ether</s><s id="section3sent5">He firmly established, and set it to be at once a boundary and guard of all that is within.</s><s id="section3sent6">(Apparently its name “Heaven” is derived from the former word.</s><s id="section3sent7">)</s><s id="section3sent8">And (surpassing wonder!) this Doer of wondrous works caused earth, a dry substance in danger of being dissolved by water, to be held by</s><s id="section3sent9">water, and air, of itself coldest of all things, to be held by fire whose very nature is heat.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">How can it be other than a prodigy that the</s><s id="section4sent2">dissolving element should be held together by that which it dissolves, water by earth; and that on the coldest element the hottest should be seated un-quenched, fire upon air?</s><s id="section4sent3">The elements
of which we have spoken are the perfect branches of the whole, but the stock, far greater and more productive than all of them, is this world, of which the growths that have been mentioned are offshoots.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">We must consider, therefore, where He caused its</s><s id="section5sent2">roots to strike, and on what it rests as a statue on its pedestal.</s><s id="section5sent3">It is unlikely that any material body has been left over and was moving about at random outside, seeing that God had wrought up and placed in orderly position all matter wherever found.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">For it</s><s id="section6sent2">became the greatest artificer to fashion to full perfection the greatest of constructions, and it would have come short of full perfection, had it not had a complement of perfect parts.</s><s id="section6sent3">Accordingly this world of ours was formed out of all that there is of earth, and all that there is of water, and air and fire, not even the smallest particle being left outside.</s><s id="section6sent4">It 7 follows that outside there is either empty space or nothing at all.</s><s id="section6sent5">If there is empty space, how comes</s><s id="section6sent6">it that a thing that is full and dense and heaviest of all existences does not sink down by sheer weight, having nothing solid external to it to hold it up?</s><s id="section6sent7">This would seem to be of the nature of a phantom, since our understanding ever looks for a material basis, which it expects everything to have, even if it be but an empty thing, but above all the world, since it is the largest of material bodies, and holds in its bosom as parts of itself amass of other material bodies.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">Let anyone then, who would fain escape the confusion</s><s id="section7sent2">of face, which we all feel when we have to leave problems unsolved, say plainly that no material thing is so strong as to be able to bear the burden of the world; and that the everlasting Word of the eternal God is the very sure and staunch prop of the Whole.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">He it is, who extending Himself</s><s id="section8sent2">from the midst to its utmost bounds and from its extremities to the midst again, keeps up through all its length Nature’s unvanquished course, combining and compacting all its parts.</s><s id="section8sent3">For the Father Who begat Him constituted His Word such a Bond of the Universe as nothing can break.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">Good reason, then,</s><s id="section9sent2">have we to be sure that all the earth shall not be dissolved by all the water which has gathered within its hollows; nor fire be quenched by air; nor, on the other hand, air be ignited by fire.</s><s id="section9sent3">The Divine Word stations Himself to keep these elements apart, like a Vocal between voiceless elements of speech, that the universe may send forth a harmony like that of a masterpiece of literature.</s><s id="section9sent4">He mediates between the opponents amid their threatenings, and reconciles them by winning ways to peace and concord.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">On this wise was the tree</s><s id="section10sent2">planted which yields all fruit that grows.</s><s id="section10sent3">On this wise when planted was it held fast.</s><s id="section10sent4">Among lesser plants, that did not partake of its universal character, some were created with a capacity of moving from one place to another, others, meant to be stationary, lacked such capacity for change of place.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Our name</s><s id="section11sent2">for those which have the power of locomotion is animals.</s><s id="section11sent3">These took to (i.e. were so made as naturally to belong to) the several main divisions of our universe, land animals to earth, to water those that swim, the winged creatures to air, and to fire the fire-born.</s><s id="section11sent4">It is said that the production of these last is more patent to observation in Macedonia than elsewhere.</s><s id="section11sent5">The stars found their place in heaven.</s><s id="section11sent6">Those who have made philosophy their study tell us that these too are living creatures, but of a kind composed entirely of Mind.</s><s id="section11sent7">Of these some, the planets, appear to change their position by a power inherent in themselves, others to do so as they are swept along in the rush of our universe, and these we call fixed stars.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">The creations endowed</s><s id="section12sent2">with a nature incapable of taking in impressions, to which the name of “plants” is specially given, do not share the power of locomotion.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Of twofold kind were the beings which the great</s><s id="section13sent2">Maker made as well in the earth as in the air.</s><s id="section13sent3">In the air He made the winged creatures perceived by our senses, and other mighty beings besides which are wholly beyond apprehension by sense.</s><s id="section13sent4">This is the host of the bodiless souls.</s><s id="section13sent5">Their array is made up of companies that differ in kind.</s><s id="section13sent6">We are told that some enter into mortal bodies, and quit them again at certain fixed periods, while others, endowed with</s><s id="section13sent7">a diviner constitution, have no regard for any earthly quarter, but exist on high nigh to the ethereal region itself.</s><s id="section13sent8">These are the purest spirits of all, whom Greek philosophers call heroes, but whom Moses, employing a well-chosen name, entitles
“angels,” for they go on embassies bearing tidings from the great Ruler to His subjects of the boons which He sends them, and reporting to the Monarch what His subjects are in need of.</s><s id="section13sent9">|</s><s id="section13sent10">Two
kinds again did He assign to earth, land animals and plants.</s><s id="section13sent11">For</s><s id="section13sent12">He willed her to be at once both mother and nurse.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">For, even as in woman and all female</s><s id="section14sent2">kind there well up springs of milk when the time of delivery draws near, that they may furnish necessary drink of a suitable kind to their offspring; even so in like manner did the Creator bestow on earth, the mother of land animals, plants of all sorts, to the end that the new-born might have the benefit of nourishment not foreign but akin to them.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">Furthermore,</s><s id="section15sent2">while</s><s id="section15sent3">He fashioned the plants head downwards, fixing their heads in the portions of the earth where the soil lay deepest,</s><s id="section15sent4">He raised from the earth the heads of the animals that are without reason and set them on the top of a long neck, placing the fore feet as a support for the neck.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">But the build allotted to man</s><s id="section16sent2">was distinguished above that of other living creatures.</s><s id="section16sent3">For by turning the eyes of the others downwards</s><s id="section16sent4">He made them incline to the earth beneath them.</s><s id="section16sent5">The eyes of man, on the contrary, He set high up, that he might gaze on heaven, for man, as the old saying is, is a plant not earthly but heavenly.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">Now while</s><s id="section17sent2">others, by asserting that our human mind is a particle</s><s id="section17sent3">of the ethereal substance, have claimed for man a kinship with the upper air; our great Moses likened the fashion of the reasonable soul to no created thing, but averred it to be a genuine coinage of that dread Spirit, the Divine and Invisible One, signed and impressed by the seal of God, the stamp of which is the Eternal Word.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">His words are “God in-breathed</s><s id="section18sent2">into his face a breath of Life” (Gen. ii.</s><s id="section18sent3">7); so that it cannot but be that he that receives is made in the likeness of Him Who sends forth the breath.</s><s id="section18sent4">Accordingly we also read that man has been made after the Image of God (Gen. i. 27), not however after the image of anything created.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">It followed then, as a</s><s id="section19sent2">natural consequence of man’s soul having been made after the image of the Archetype, the Word of the First Cause, that his body also was made erect, and could lift up its eyes to heaven, the purest portion of our universe, that by means of that which he could see man might clearly apprehend that which he could not see.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Since, then, it was impossible for</s><s id="section20sent2">any to discern how the understanding tends towards the Existent One, save those only who had been drawn by Him—for each one of us knows what he has himself experienced as no other can know it—</s><s id="section20sent3">He
endows the bodily eyes with the power of taking the direction of the upper air, and so makes them a distinct representation of the invisible eye.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">For,</s><s id="section21sent2">seeing that the eyes formed out of perishable matter obtained so great reach as to travel from the earthly region to heaven, that is so far away, and to touch its bounds, how vast must we deem the flight in all directions of the eyes of the soul?</s><s id="section21sent3">The strong yearning to perceive the Existent One gives them wings to attain not only to the furthest region of the upper</s><s id="section21sent4">air, but to overpass the very bounds of the entire universe and speed away toward the Uncreate.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">This is why those who crave for</s><s id="section22sent2">wisdom and knowledge with insatiable persistence are said in the Sacred Oracles to have been called upwards; for it accords with God’s ways that those who have received His down-breathing should be called up to Him.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">For when trees are whirled up,</s><s id="section23sent2">roots and all, into the air by hurricanes and tornadoes, and heavily laden ships of large tonnage are snatched up out of mid-ocean, as though objects of very little weight, and lakes and rivers are borne aloft, and earth’s hollows are left empty by the water as it is drawn up by a tangle of violently eddying winds, it is strange if a light substance like the mind is not rendered buoyant and raised to the utmost height by the native force of the Divine spirit, overcoming as it does in its boundless might all powers that are here below.</s><s id="section23sent3">Above all is it strange if this is not so with the mind of the genuine philosopher.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">Such an one suffers from no weight of downward</s><s id="section24sent2">pressure towards the objects dear to the body and to earth.</s><s id="section24sent3">From these he has ever made an earnest effort to sever and estrange himself.</s><s id="section24sent4">So he is borne upward insatiably enamoured of all holy happy natures that dwell on high.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">Accordingly Moses,</s><s id="section25sent2">the keeper and guardian of the mysteries of the Existent One, will be one called above; for it is said in the Book of Leviticus, “He called Moses up above”
(Lev. i. 1).</s><s id="section25sent3">One called up above will Bezeleel also be, held worthy of a place in the second rank.</s><s id="section25sent4">For him also does</s><s id="section25sent5">God call up above for the construction and overseeing of the sacred works (Exod. xxxi.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">2 ff.).</s><s id="section26sent2">But while Bezeleel shall carry off the lower honours</s><s id="section26sent3">conferred by the call above, Moses the all-wise shall bear away the primary honours.</s><s id="section26sent4">For the former fashions the shadows, just as painters do, to whom Heaven has not granted power to create aught that has life.</s><s id="section26sent5">“Bezeleel,” we must remember, means
“making in shadows.”</s><s id="section26sent6">Moses on the other hand obtained the office of producing not shadows but the actual archetype of the several objects.</s><s id="section26sent7">Nor need we wonder at such distinctions.</s><s id="section26sent8">It is the wont of the Supreme Cause to exhibit the objects proper to each, to some in a clearer, more radiant vision, as though in unclouded sunshine, to others more dimly, as though in the shade.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">As we have now brought to a close our discussion</s><s id="section27sent2">of those objects on a larger scale which are set to grow in the field of the universe, let us note the way in which God the all-wise fashioned the trees that are in man, the microcosm.</s><s id="section27sent3">To begin with, then, He took our body, as though He were taking some deep-soiled plot of ground and made the organs of sense as tree-beds for it.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">Having done this He</s><s id="section28sent2">set a sense in each of them, as a plant highly valuable for cultivation, hearing in the ear, sight in the eyes, in the nostrils scent, and the rest in their appropriate and congenial positions.</s><s id="section28sent3">I may cite as a witness to what I say the sacred poet, where he says “He that planteth the ear, doth He not hear?</s><s id="section28sent4">He that fashioneth the eyes, shall He not behold?” (Psalm xciv.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">9).</s><s id="section29sent2">And all the other faculties of the body</s><s id="section29sent3">including legs and hands and every part, whether inner or outer, are nothing else than noble shoots and growths.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">The better and more perfect growths He</s><s id="section30sent2">planted in the dominant faculty, which holds the central position, and possesses in a pre-eminent</s><s id="section30sent3">degree the capacity for yielding fruit.</s><s id="section30sent4">These growths are insight, apprehension, accurate judgement, constant practice, powers of memory, varying conditions, chronic dispositions,</s><s id="section30sent5">scientific capacity taking many forms and directions, certainty of knowledge, ability to take in and retain the principles and implications of virtue in every shape.</s><s id="section30sent6">Not one of these is any mortal man whatever capable of growing.</s><s id="section30sent7">The One Grower of them all is the Uncreate Artificer, Who not only has made these plants once for all, but is ever making them in the case of each man who is from time to time begotten.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">In agreement with what I have said is the</s><s id="section31sent2">planting of the garden; for we read, “God planted a garden in Eden facing the sun-rising, and placed there the man whom He had moulded” (Gen. ii. 8).</s><s id="section31sent3">To imagine that he planted vines and olive and apple and pomegranate trees or the like, would be serious folly, difficult to eradicate.</s><s id="section31sent4">One would 33 naturally ask What for?</s><s id="section31sent5">To provide Himself with convenient places to live in?</s><s id="section31sent6">Would the whole world be considered a sufficient dwelling for God the Lord of all?</s><s id="section31sent7">Would it not evidently fall short in countless other ways</s><s id="section31sent8">of being deemed meet to receive the Great King?</s><s id="section31sent9">To say nothing of the irreverence of supposing that the Cause of all things is contained in that which He has caused, and to say nothing of the fact that the trees of His planting do not yield annual fruits as ours do.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">For whose use</s><s id="section32sent2">and enjoyment, then, will the Garden yield its fruits?</s><s id="section32sent3">Not for that of any man; for no one whatever is mentioned as dwelling in the garden, for we are told that Adam, the man first moulded out of the earth,</s><s id="section32sent4">migrated thence.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">As for God, He stands in no need of</s><s id="section33sent2">food any more than of aught else.</s><s id="section33sent3">For one who uses food must in the first place experience need, and in the next place be equipped with organs by means of which to take the food that comes in, and to discharge that from which he has drawn its goodness.</s><s id="section33sent4">These things are not in harmony with the blessedness and happiness of the First Cause.</s><s id="section33sent5">They are utterly monstrous inventions of men who would overthrow great virtues like piety and reverence by representing Him as having the form and passions of mankind.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">So we must turn to allegory, the method dear</s><s id="section34sent2">to men with their eyes opened.</s><s id="section34sent3">Indeed the sacred oracles most evidently afford us the clues for the use of this method.</s><s id="section34sent4">For they say that in the garden there are trees in no way resembling those with which we are familiar, but trees of Life, of Immortality, of Knowledge, of Apprehension, of Understanding, of the conception of good and evil.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">And</s><s id="section35sent2">these can be no growths of earthly soil, but must be those of the reasonable soul, namely its path according to virtue with life and immortality as its end, and its path according to evil ending in the shunning of these and in death.</s><s id="section35sent3">We must conceive therefore that the bountiful God plants in the soul as it were a garden of virtues and of the modes of conduct corresponding to each of them, a garden that brings the soul to perfect happiness.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Because of this</s><s id="section36sent2">He assigned to the garden a site</s><s id="section36sent3">most suitable, bearing the name of “Eden,” which means “luxuriance,” symbol of a soul whose eyesight is perfect, disporting itself in virtues, leaping and skipping by reason of abundance of great joy, having set before it, as an enjoyment outweighing thousands</s><s id="section36sent4">of those that men deem sweetest, the worship and service of the Only Wise.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">One, after taking a sheer</s><s id="section37sent2">draught of this bright joy, a member indeed of Moses’ fellowship, not found among the indifferent, spake aloud in hymns of praise, and addressing his own mind cried, “Delight in the Lord” (Psalm xxxvi.</s><s id="section37sent3">4), moved by the utterance to an ecstasy of the love that is heavenly and Divine, filled with loathing for those interminable bouts of softness and debauchery amid the seeming and so-called good things of mankind, while his whole mind is snatched up in holy frenzy by a Divine possession, and he finds his gladness in God alone.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">A proof of what I</s><s id="section38sent2">have said is the nearness of the garden to the sun-rising
(Gen. ii.</s><s id="section38sent3">8); for, while folly is a thing sinking, dark, night-bringing, wisdom is verily a thing of sunrise, all radiancy and brightness.</s><s id="section38sent4">And even as the sun, when it comes up, fills all the circle of heaven with light, even so do the rays of virtue, when they have shone out, cause the whole region of the understanding to be flooded with pure brilliancy.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">Now, whereas man’s possessions have animals of</s><s id="section39sent2">great ferocity to watch and guard them against being attacked and overrun, the possessions of God are guarded by rational beings: for it says, “He stationed there the man whom He had fashioned,”
that is to say, the trainings in and exercises of the virtues belong to rational beings only.</s></p></div>
