On Joseph
that is, the Life of the statesman
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">The factors which produce consummate excellence</s><s id="section1sent2">are three in number: learning, nature, practice.</s><s id="section1sent3">And these names are represented in three of the wise men to whom Moses gives the senior place.</s><s id="section1sent4">Since I have described the lives of these three, the life which results from teaching, the life of the self-taught and the life of practice, I will carry on the series by describing a fourth life, that of the statesman.</s><s id="section1sent5">This name again has its representation in one of the patriarchs who, as Moses shews, was trained to his calling from his earliest youth.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">This training was first given to him at about the age</s><s id="section2sent2">of seventeen by the lore of the shepherd’s craft,</s><s id="section2sent3">which corresponds closely to the lore of statesmanship.</s><s id="section2sent4">And therefore I think the order of poets often speaks of kings as shepherds of peoples,</s><s id="section2sent5">for success in shepherding will produce the best king, since through the charge of flocks which deserve less thought and care he has been taught the charge of the noblest flock of living creatures—mankind.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">And, just as to the future leaders in wars, or in commanding</s><s id="section3sent2">armies, practice in the hunting-field is most necessary, so to those who hope to superintend a state nothing is so suitable as shepherding, which gives practice in the exercise of authority and</s><s id="section3sent3">generalship.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">So his father, observing in him a noble</s><s id="section4sent2">spirit which rose above ordinary conditions, rendered to him high admiration and respect, while his love for this child of his later years—and nothing conduces to affection more than this—exceeded his love for his other sons.</s><s id="section4sent3">And being himself a lover of excellence, by special and exceptional attentions he fostered the fire of the boy’s nature, in the hope that it would not merely smoulder but burst rapidly into flame.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">But envy, which is ever</s><s id="section5sent2">the enemy of high success, in this case too set to work and created division in a household where every part had been happily flourishing, and stirred up the many brethren against the one.</s><s id="section5sent3">They displayed ill-will to Joseph as a counterpoise to his father’s goodwill, and equalled his love with their hatred.</s><s id="section5sent4">They did not, however, proclaim that hatred aloud, but kept it a secret among themselves, and thus it naturally grew to greater bitterness.</s><s id="section5sent5">For emotions which are cooped up and find no vent become more violent because expression is stifled.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Joseph in the</s><s id="section6sent2">simple innocence of his nature had no notion of the enmity which was lurking in his brothers’ hearts, and, believing them to be friendly, told them a significant dream which he had seen.</s><s id="section6sent3">“I thought,” he said, “that harvest-time was with us, and that we had all come to the plain to gather in the crops.</s><s id="section6sent4">We had taken our sickles and were reaping, when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood bolt upright, while yours, as though at a signal, rushed up in astonishment and did homage to mine with every mark of honour.”</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">His brothers, being men of keen intelligence, skilful</s><s id="section7sent2">at interpreting symbols and thus by probable conjectures discovering the obscure, replied: “Do you think that you will be our lord and king?</s><s id="section7sent3">For that is what you hint at in this lying vision.”</s><s id="section7sent4">And their hatred, ever finding some new ground to augment it, was still more kindled against him.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">He,</s><s id="section8sent2">suspecting nothing, a few days after saw and told his brothers another dream even more astounding than the former.</s><s id="section8sent3">In this he dreamt that the sun and moon and eleven stars came and did him homage.</s><s id="section8sent4">This caused surprise to his father, who laid up the matter in his mind and carefully watched to see what the outcome would be.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">But, fearing that the boy</s><s id="section9sent2">had made a serious mistake,</s><s id="section9sent3">he chid him severely, saying, “You seem to mean by the sun your father and by the moon your mother and by the eleven stars your eleven brothers.</s><s id="section9sent4">Can it be that I and your mother and your brothers shall do you homage?</s><s id="section9sent5">Let no such thought ever enter your mind, my son, and let the memory of what you saw insensibly fade away.</s><s id="section9sent6">For the idea of hoping and eagerly expecting to gain dominion over your family is very odious in my judgement, and I think that all who care for equality and justice between kinsfolk must agree.”</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">Then, dreading lest continued association</s><s id="section10sent2">should breed disturbance and broils among the brothers through the grudge which they bore against the dreamer for his visions, Jacob sent them away to tend the sheep, but kept him at home for such season as should prove needed.</s><s id="section10sent3">He knew that time</s><s id="section10sent4">is said to be the physician of the distempers and ailments of the soul and is able to remove grief, to quench anger and to heal fear, for time relieves everything, even what is naturally hard to cure.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">But when he guessed that they would have ceased</s><s id="section11sent2">to harbour enmity in their hearts, he sent him partly to salute his brothers and partly to bring him word how it fared with themselves and the flocks under their charge.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">This journey proved to be the source of great</s><s id="section12sent2">evil and great good, both exceeding anything that could have been expected.</s><s id="section12sent3">For Joseph, in obedience to his father’s commands, went to his brethren, but they, when they saw him coming afar off, talked to each other, and their language was very sinister.</s><s id="section12sent4">They did not even deign to speak of him by his name, but called him the dream-driveller and the vision-monger and similar terms.</s><s id="section12sent5">Their anger reached such a pitch that they plotted by a majority, though not unanimously, to murder him, and in order to avoid detection they determined to throw his dead body into a very deep pit in the ground.</s><s id="section12sent6">In that region there are many such, made to hold the rain-water.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">And they were only deterred from</s><s id="section13sent2">committing that most accursed of deeds, fratricide, by the exhortation of the eldest among them, to which they reluctantly yielded.</s><s id="section13sent3">He urged them to keep their souls clear from the abominable act, and merely to throw him into one of the deep pits, thinking to contrive some means for saving him and hoping when they had gone away to take him up and send him to their father quite unharmed.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">When</s><s id="section14sent2">they had agreed to this, Joseph approached and saluted them, but they caught hold of him as though</s><s id="section14sent3">he were an enemy in battle and stripped him of his coat.</s><s id="section14sent4">They then let him down by ropes into the open depths.</s><s id="section14sent5">His coat they dyed red in the blood of a kid, and sent it to his father with the story that wild beasts had made away with him.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">Now it chanced that day that some merchants</s><s id="section15sent2">belonging to a caravan which was wont to carry wares from Arabia to Egypt were travelling that way.</s><s id="section15sent3">To these they sold their brother, after hauling him up, the leader in this plan being the fourth eldest brother.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">He, I imagine, feared that Joseph might be treacherously murdered by the others who were inflamed with such merciless wrath against him, and therefore advised them to sell him and thus substitute the</s><s id="section16sent2">lesser evil of slavery for the greater evil of death.</s><s id="section16sent3">The eldest brother had not been present at the sale.</s><s id="section16sent4">When he looked down into the pit and did not see the boy whom he had left there a short time before, he cried aloud and shouted, rent his garments and rushed up and down like a madman, beating his hands together and tearing his hair.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">“Tell me,” he cried, “what</s><s id="section17sent2">has become of him.</s><s id="section17sent3">Is he alive or dead?</s><s id="section17sent4">If he is no more, shew me his dead body, that I may weep over the corpse and thus make the calamity seem lighter.</s><s id="section17sent5">If I see him lying here I shall be comforted.</s><s id="section17sent6">Why do we still bear a grudge to the dead?</s><s id="section17sent7">Envy cannot fasten on the departed.</s><s id="section17sent8">But if he is alive where on earth has he gone?</s><s id="section17sent9">In whose charge is he kept?</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Tell me, for you cannot suspect me as well as him that</s><s id="section18sent2">you should refuse me your confidence.”</s><s id="section18sent3">When they said that he had been sold, and shewed the price that had been paid, “A fine bargain you have made,”</s><s id="section18sent4">he said.</s><s id="section18sent5">“Let us divide the profits.</s><s id="section18sent6">We have competed with slave-dealers for the prize of wickedness;</s><s id="section18sent7">let us wear the crown, and glory that we surpass them in cruelty, for their designs are aimed against aliens, ours against our nearest and dearest.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">A great and</s><s id="section19sent2">novel reproach has been brought about, a far-famed disgrace.</s><s id="section19sent3">Our fathers left behind in every part of the world records of their noble conduct; we shall leave behind us beyond all retrieving the scandal of our faithlessness and inhumanity.</s><s id="section19sent4">For, when deeds of grave import are done, the rumours of them reach everywhere, causing admiration where they are praiseworthy, censure and contumely when they are guilty.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">How will our father receive the report of the</s><s id="section20sent2">event?</s><s id="section20sent3">Thrice blessed he was and thrice happy, and ye have made his life with us</s><s id="section20sent4">intolerable.</s><s id="section20sent5">Which will he pity most, the sold for his enslavement or the sellers for their cruelty?</s><s id="section20sent6">Surely us far more than him, since it is less grievous to suffer wrong than to do it.</s><s id="section20sent7">The former is assisted by two mighty forces, pity and hope; the latter has no part in either, and in the judgement of all comes off the worst.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">But why</s><s id="section21sent2">do I lament thus wildly?</s><s id="section21sent3">It were better to hold my peace, lest I too come in for a share in some horrible fate.</s><s id="section21sent4">For ye are exceedingly savage of temper and merciless, and the fierceness in each heart is still in full blast.”</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">When his father heard, not the truth that his</s><s id="section22sent2">son had been sold, but the lie that he was dead and had seemingly been devoured by wild beasts, the words that he heard and the sight that he saw fell like a blow on his ears and eyes.</s><s id="section22sent3">For Joseph’s tunic had been brought to him rent and marred and stained scarlet with much blood.</s><s id="section22sent4">Collapsing under his great</s><s id="section22sent5">emotion, he lay for a great while with closed lips, not even able to lift his head, so utterly did the calamity afflict and break him down.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">Then, suddenly pouring</s><s id="section23sent2">forth tears like a fountain, he watered his cheeks and chin and breast and his own raiment, while bitterly wailing, and uttered such words as these: “Child, it is not your death which grieves me, but the manner of it.</s><s id="section23sent3">If you had been buried in your own land, I should have comforted and watched and nursed your sick-bed, exchanged the last farewells as you died, closed your eyes, wept over the body as it lay there, given it a costly funeral and left none of the customary rites undone.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">Nay, even if it had been on foreign</s><s id="section24sent2">soil, I should have said to myself: ‘Man, be not downcast that nature has recovered the forfeit that was her due.’</s><s id="section24sent3">Separate countries concern the living: every land is the tomb of the dead.</s><s id="section24sent4">Death comes early to none, or rather it comes early to all, for few are the years of the longest-lived compared with eternity.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">And, indeed, if you needs must have died</s><s id="section25sent2">by violence or through premeditation, it would have been a lighter ill to me, slain as you would have been by human beings, who would have pitied their dead victim, gathered some dust and covered the corpse.</s><s id="section25sent3">And then if they had been the cruellest of men, what more could they have done but cast it out unburied and go their way, and then perhaps some passer-by would have stayed his steps, and, as he looked, felt pity for our common nature and deemed the tendance of burial to be its due.</s><s id="section25sent4">But, as it is, you have become, in common phrase, a rich banquet for savage carnivorous beasts who have found my own flesh and blood to their taste, and feasted thereon.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">I am long</s><s id="section26sent2">trained in the athletics of adversity, drilled by many a random stroke of misfortune, a wanderer, a stranger, a serf, a thrall, my very life and soul a mark for the malice of those by whom I should least have been so treated.</s><s id="section26sent3">Many desperate calamities I have seen and heard: thousands of them have I experienced myself, but trained to moderate my feelings at such I remained unmoved.</s><s id="section26sent4">But none was more unbearable than this event which has overturned and destroyed the strength of my soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">For what sorrow could be</s><s id="section27sent2">greater or more pitiful?</s><s id="section27sent3">My son’s raiment has been conveyed to me, his father, but not a part of him, not a limb, not a tiny fragment.</s><s id="section27sent4">But, while he has been utterly made away with beyond even any possibility of burial, his raiment too would not have been sent to me at all save to remind me of my sorrow, and to make his sufferings live again as calamities constant and indelible to myself.</s><s id="section27sent5">“Thus did he bewail.</s><s id="section27sent6">But the merchants sold the boy in Egypt to one of the king’s eunuchs who was his chief cook.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">After this literal account of the story, it will</s><s id="section28sent2">be well to explain the underlying meaning, for, broadly speaking, all or most of the law-book is an allegory.</s><s id="section28sent3">The kind of character then here under discussion is called in the Hebrew “Joseph,” but in our language is “addition of a lord,” a most significant title well suited to the thing which it indicates, since polity as seen in the various peoples is an addition to nature who is invested with a universal lordship.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">For this world is the Megalopolis or “great city,”</s><s id="section29sent2">and it has a single polity and a single law, and this is the word or reason of nature, commanding what should be done and forbidding what should not be done.</s><s id="section29sent3">But the local cities which we see are unlimited in number and subject to diverse polities and laws by no means identical, for different peoples have different customs and regulations which are extra inventions and additions.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">The cause of this is the reluctance to</s><s id="section30sent2">combine or have fellowship with each other, shewn not only by Greeks to barbarians and barbarians to Greeks, but also within each of them separately in dealing with their own kin.</s><s id="section30sent3">And then we find them alleging causes for this which are no real causes, such as unfavourable seasons, want of fertility, poverty of soil or how the state is situated, whether it is maritime or inland or whether it is on an island or on the mainland and the like.</s><s id="section30sent4">The true cause they never mention, and that is their covetousness and mutual mistrusts, which keep them from being satisfied with the ordinances of nature, and lead them to give the name of laws to whatever approves itself as advantageous to the communities which hold the same views.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Thus naturally particular polities are rather</s><s id="section31sent2">an addition to the single polity of nature, for the laws of the different states are additions to the right reason of nature, and the politician is an addition to the man whose life accords with nature.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">Further, he is quite properly said to assume a</s><s id="section32sent2">coat of varied colours,</s><s id="section32sent3">for political life is a thing varied and multiple, liable to innumerable changes brought about by personalities, circumstances,</s><s id="section32sent4">motives, individualities of conduct, differences in occasions and places.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">The pilot is helped to a successful</s><s id="section33sent2">voyage by means which change with the changes of the wind, and does not confine his guidance of the ship to one method.</s><s id="section33sent3">The physician does not use a single form of treatment for all his patients, nor even for an individual if the physical condition does not remain unaltered, but he watches the lowering and the heightening of the strain, its alternations of fullness and emptiness and all the changes of symptoms,</s><s id="section33sent4">and varies his salutary processes, sometimes using one kind and sometimes another.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">And</s><s id="section34sent2">so too the politician must needs be a man of many sides and many forms.</s><s id="section34sent3">He must be a different man in peace from what he is in war, another man as those who venture to oppose him are few or many, resisting the few with vigorous action but using persuasion in his dealings with the many, and when danger is involved he will, to effect the common good, outstrip all others in his personal activity, but when the prospect is one of labour merely he will stand aside and leave others to serve him.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">Again it</s><s id="section35sent2">is rightly said that this person is sold, for when the would-be popular orator mounts the platform, like a slave in the market, he becomes a bond-servant instead of a free man, and, through the seeming honours which he receives, the captive of a thousand masters.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Again, he is also represented as the prey</s><s id="section36sent2">of wild beasts, and indeed the vainglory which lies in ambush and then seizes and destroys those who</s><s id="section36sent3">indulge it is a savage beast.</s><s id="section36sent4">Once more his purchasers sell him again, for politicians have not one but a multitude of masters who buy them one from another, each waiting to take his turn in the succession, and those who are thus sold again and again like bad servants change their masters, because, capricious and fitful in character as they are and ever hankering after novelty, they cannot endure their old lords.</s><s id="section36sent5">Enough on this subject also.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">To resume the</s><s id="section37sent2">story, when the youth had been brought to Egypt and as I have said placed with the eunuch as his master, he gave proof in a few days of his nobility of character and nature, and therefore he received authority over his fellow-servants and the charge of the whole household; for his owner had already observed many signs that everything which he said or did was under God’s directing care.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">So, while in outward</s><s id="section38sent2">appearance it was his purchaser who appointed him steward of his household, in fact and reality it was nature’s</s><s id="section38sent3">doing, who was taking steps to procure for him the command of whole cities and a nation and a great country.</s><s id="section38sent4">For the future statesman needed first to be trained and practised in house management; for a house is a city compressed into small dimensions, and household management may be called a kind of state management, just as a city too is a great house and statesmanship the household management of the general public.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">All this shews</s><s id="section39sent2">clearly that the household manager is identical with the statesman, however much what is under the purview of the two may differ in number and size.</s><s id="section39sent3">The same holds with sculpture and painting, for the</s><s id="section39sent4">good statuary or painter, whether the works which he produces are many and of colossal size or few and smaller, is the same man exhibiting the same skill.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">But while he was winning a high reputation</s><s id="section40sent2">in household affairs, his master’s wife made him the object of her designs, which were prompted by licentious love; for wrought up to madness by the beauty of the youth, and putting no restraint upon the frenzy of her passion, she made proposals of intercourse to him which he stoutly resisted and utterly refused to accept, so strong was the sense of decency and temperance which nature and the exercise of control had implanted in him.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">And,</s><s id="section41sent2">since, as she fed the fire of lawless lust till it burst into a blaze, her constant efforts to gain him as constantly failed, at last in an accession of passion she was fain to employ violence.</s><s id="section41sent3">She caught hold of his outer garment and powerfully drew him to her bed by superior force, since passion which often braces even the weakest gave her new vigour.</s></p></div>
