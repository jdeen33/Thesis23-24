Flaccus
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">The policy of attacking the Jews begun by</s><s id="section1sent2">Sejanus</s><s id="section1sent3">was taken over by Flaccus Avillius.</s><s id="section1sent4">He had not like his predecessor the power to ill-treat outright the whole nation, for he had less opportunities of doing so, but those whom he reached suffered the direst misery from the stabs which he dealt to them one and all.</s><s id="section1sent5">And, indeed, though his assault appeared to be only partial, by employing craft rather than power he brought them all wherever they were within the scope of his hostility.</s><s id="section1sent6">For persons naturally tyrannical who have not the addition of strength achieve their malignant designs through cunning.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">This Flaccus then, who had been given a</s><s id="section2sent2">place in the suite of Tiberius Caesar, was after the death of Iberus,</s><s id="section2sent3">who had been prefect of Egypt, made prefect of Alexandria and the country round it.</s><s id="section2sent4">He was a man who at first gave to all appearance a multitude of proofs of high excellence.</s><s id="section2sent5">He was sagacious and assiduous, quick to think out and execute his plans, very ready at speaking, and at understanding what was left unspoken better even than what was said.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">So in quite a short time he</s><s id="section3sent2">became thoroughly familiar with Egyptian affairs,</s><s id="section3sent3">intricate and diversified as they are and hardly-grasped even by those who have made a business of studying them from their earliest years.</s><s id="section3sent4">His crowd of secretaries were a superfluity, since nothing small or great was beyond the reach of his experience, so that he not only surpassed them but thanks to his mastery of detail became the teacher instead of the pupil of his erstwhile instructors.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">And</s><s id="section4sent2">all matters connected with accountancy and administration of the revenue he managed successfully.</s><s id="section4sent3">These indeed, great and vital though they were, did not supply proof that he possessed the soul of a leader of men, but in a more open way</s><s id="section4sent4">he displayed qualities which revealed a more brilliant and kingly nature.</s><s id="section4sent5">Thus he bore himself with dignity, for outward pomp is very useful to a ruler.</s><s id="section4sent6">He judged important cases with the help of those in authority, humbled the arrogant and prevented any motley promiscuous horde of people from combining in opposition.</s><s id="section4sent7">The sodalities and clubs, which were constantly holding feasts under pretext of sacrifice in which drunkenness vented itself in political intrigue,</s><s id="section4sent8">he dissolved and dealt sternly and vigorously
with the refractory.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Then when he had fully</s><s id="section5sent2">established good order throughout the city and the country he began to turn his attention to supporting</s><s id="section5sent3">the armed forces.</s><s id="section5sent4">He set them in array,</s><s id="section5sent5">drilled, exercised them, cavalry, infantry and light-armed</s><s id="section5sent6">alike, training the officers not to withhold the pay of their men and so incite them to pillage and rapine, and also each single soldier not to interfere in things outside his military duties but remember</s><s id="section5sent7">that he had been appointed also to maintain the peace.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Possibly someone may say “My dear sir, after</s><s id="section6sent2">deciding to accuse a man you have stated no charge but come out with a long string of praises.</s><s id="section6sent3">Are you out of your senses and gone quite mad?”</s><s id="section6sent4">No, my friend, I have not gone mad and I am not a silly person who cannot see what the sequence of an argument demands.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">I praise Flaccus not because I</s><s id="section7sent2">thought it right to laud an enemy but to show his villainy in a clearer light.</s><s id="section7sent3">For to one who sins through ignorance of a better course pardon may be given, but a wrongdoer who has knowledge has no defence but stands already convicted at the bar of his conscience.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">Flaccus held his prefectship</s><s id="section8sent2">for six years and for the first five of these while Tiberius Caesar was alive maintained peace and held command with such activity and vigour that he excelled all his predecessors.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">But in the last year</s><s id="section9sent2">when Tiberius was dead and Gaius had been appointed Emperor he began to let everything slip from his hands.</s><s id="section9sent3">This may have been due to his profound grief at the death of Tiberius.</s><s id="section9sent4">For how greatly he mourned the loss of one whom he looked on as his closest friend was shown by his constant depression and the stream of tears which poured ceaselessly from</s><s id="section9sent5">him as from a fountain.</s><s id="section9sent6">Or it may have been the ill-will he bore to his successor, since he had been a devoted partisan of the actual</s><s id="section9sent7">rather than the adopted children.</s><s id="section9sent8">Or again as he had been one of those who had attacked Gaius’s mother when she lay under the charges for which she was put to death, his fear of being held guilty on this count caused him to neglect his duties.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">And for a time he held out</s><s id="section10sent2">and did not entirely lose his grasp of affairs, but when he heard that the grandson of Tiberius,</s><s id="section10sent3">who shared the sovereignty, had been killed by Gaius’s orders, this misfortune was so terrible a blow that he threw himself down and lay speechless, and for a considerable time before</s><s id="section10sent4">this his thinking powers had become feeble and paralysed.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">For while the youth lived,</s><s id="section11sent2">his hopes of preserving his own safety were still alight, but with his death it seemed that his personal hopes had died also, even though some little waft of possible assistance still reached him in his friendship with Macro, who originally was all-powerful with Gaius, said to have contributed more than anyone to his gaining the principate and still more to his preservation.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">For Tiberius had been often minded to</s><s id="section12sent2">get Gaius out of the way as a person ill-disposed and devoid of natural gifts for rulership, and also because he was concerned for his grandson, who he feared might at his death be got rid of as an encumbrance.</s><s id="section12sent3">But Macro often tried to eliminate his suspicions and would praise Gaius as straight-forward and free from vice and liberal and particularly devoted to his cousin, so much so that he would willingly relinquish the principate to his sole charge, or, at any rate, the premier place.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Deceived by these representations</s><s id="section13sent2">Tiberius unwittingly left behind him an implacable enemy to himself, his grandson, his family, Macro the intercessor and all mankind.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">For when</s><s id="section14sent2">Macro saw him straying from the regular way and letting his impulses range unbridled any whither and in any way he would admonish and exhort him, thinking that he was the same Gaius who while Tiberius still lived was reasonable and docile.</s><s id="section14sent3">But, alas, poor wretch, for his excessive goodwill he paid the extreme penalty, being slain with his whole house, wife and children as a burden, a superfluity and a nuisance.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">For whenever Gaius caught sight</s><s id="section15sent2">of him at a distance he would talk in this strain to his companions, “Let us not smile, let us look downcast, for here comes the monitor, the stickler for straight speaking,</s><s id="section15sent3">who has begun to take charge as tutor of a grown man and an emperor, at this very time which has dismissed and set aside those who tutored him from his earliest years.”</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">So when Flaccus learnt that Macro too had</s><s id="section16sent2">been put to death he completely lost any hope that he still had and could no longer keep any grip of affairs, so utterly enfeebled was he and incapable of solid judgement.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">And when the ruler despairs of</s><s id="section17sent2">keeping control the subjects necessarily at once become restive, particularly those who are naturally excited by quite small and ordinary occurrences.</s><s id="section17sent3">Among such the Egyptian nation holds the first place, accustomed as it is to blow up the tiniest spark into grave seditions.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Flaccus, thus left without help</s><s id="section18sent2">or resources, was much agitated and at the same time as his reasoning powers deteriorated made changes in all his recent policy, beginning with his treatment of his closest companions.</s><s id="section18sent3">For he suspected and repelled those who were well disposed and particularly friendly to him, while he allied himself to those who from the first had been his avowed enemies and took them for his counsellors in every matter.</s><s id="section18sent4">But their rancour was still there.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">The</s><s id="section19sent2">apparent reconciliation was a counterfeit, existing only in words.</s><s id="section19sent3">In real fact they cherished an implacable vindictiveness and acting as in a theatre the part of genuine friends they carried him off into complete captivity.</s><s id="section19sent4">The ruler became the subject, the subjects leaders, who put forward very pernicious proposals and straightway set on them the seal of reality.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">They proceeded to confirm all their plans,</s><s id="section20sent2">and took Flaccus like a masked dummy on the stage with the title of government inscribed upon him merely for show, to be an instrument in the hands of a popularity-hunting Dionysius,</s><s id="section20sent3">a</s><s id="section20sent4">paper-poring</s><s id="section20sent5">Lampo, an Isidorus, faction leader, busy intriguer, mischief contriver and a name which has gained special currency—state embroiler.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">All</s><s id="section21sent2">these combining concerted a plot of the most damaging kind against the Jews and coming to Flaccus privately said, “Lost are your prospects from the</s><s id="section21sent3">boy Tiberius Nero, lost too the hope that you had next to him in your comrade Macro, and your expectations from the Emperor are anything but favourable.</s><s id="section21sent4">We must find you a really powerful intercessor to propitiate Gaius.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">Such an intercessor</s><s id="section22sent2">is the city of the Alexandrians which has been honoured from the first by all the Augustan house and especially by our present master; and intercede it will if it receives from you some boon, and you can give it no greater benefaction than by surrendering and sacrificing the Jews.”</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">Though on hearing these</s><s id="section23sent2">words it was his duty to repulse and frown upon the speakers as sedition-makers and enemies of the commonwealth he subscribed to their suggestions.</s><s id="section23sent3">At first he showed his hostile intentions in a somewhat less obvious way by refusing to give a fair and impartial hearing to the parties in disputes and leaning to one side only, while in all other matters he gave them no right of free speech, but whenever any Jew approached he turned away, while to all others he</s><s id="section23sent4">made himself easily accessible.</s><s id="section23sent5">But later he also showed his ill-will openly.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">The infatuation due to instruction from others</s><s id="section24sent2">rather than to his own nature, which thus was shown in his conduct, was further strengthened by the following incident.</s><s id="section24sent3">Gaius Caesar gave to Agrippa, the grandson of King Herod, the kingship over that third part of his grandfather’s territory, the revenues of which were taken by Philip the tetrarch, Agrippa’s paternal uncle.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">When he was about to set out</s><s id="section25sent2">thither Gaius advised him not to undertake the voyage from Brundisium to Syria which was long and wearisome but wait for the etesian winds and take the short route through Alexandria.</s><s id="section25sent3">He told him that thence there were swift-sailing merchant vessels and highly skilled pilots who manage them as a charioteer manages race-horses and provide a straightforward passage along the direct route.</s><s id="section25sent4">Agrippa did as he was told, partly out of deference to his lord and master, and also because the course he enjoined seemed to be advisable.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">He went down</s><s id="section26sent2">to Dicaearchia,</s><s id="section26sent3">and seeing there some ships of Alexandria lying at anchor and ready to sail he embarked with his retinue, and after a good voyage came to land a few days later without being expected or his purposes detected.</s><s id="section26sent4">He had ordered the pilots when they sighted Pharos in the late afternoon to furl the sails and lie outside round about it and not far off until the evening had well set in, and then by night to put in at the harbour, so that he might disembark when everyone had settled down to sleep and reach the house of his host without anyone seeing him.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">His reason for making his visit in such an unassuming</s><s id="section27sent2">way was that he wished if possible to slip out of the</s><s id="section27sent3">city quietly and unobserved by the whole population.</s><s id="section27sent4">For he had not come to see Alexandria as he had stayed there before on his voyage to Rome to join Tiberius, and he only wanted to get a short route for his journey home.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">But jealousy is part of the</s><s id="section28sent2">Egyptian nature, and the citizens were bursting with envy and considered that any good luck to others was misfortune to themselves, and in their ancient, and we might say innate hostility to the Jews, they resented a Jew having been made a king just as much as if each of them had thereby been deprived of an ancestral throne.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">And the unhappy Flaccus</s><s id="section29sent2">was again stirred up by his companions with incitements and appeals calculated to make him as envious as themselves.</s><s id="section29sent3">“His stay here,” they said, “is your deposition.</s><s id="section29sent4">The dignity of the honour and prestige which invest him surpasses yours; he is attracting all men to him by the sight of his bodyguard of spearmen, decked in armour overlaid with gold and silver.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Was it right for him to come to another</s><s id="section30sent2">ruler’s domain when a fair wind</s><s id="section30sent3">could have carried him safely by sea to his own?</s><s id="section30sent4">For if Gaius gave him permission or rather put compulsion on him to do so, he ought to have earnestly entreated to be excused from coming here, so that the governor of the country would not be thrown into the background and lose prestige.”</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Such words made his temper</s><s id="section31sent2">rise still more, and while in public he played the part of friend and comrade to Agrippa through fear of him who had sent him there, in private he vented his jealousy and gave full utterance to his hatred by insulting him indirectly since he had not the courage to do so outright.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">For the lazy and unoccupied mob</s><s id="section32sent2">in the city, a multitude well practised in idle talk, who devote their leisure to slandering and evil speaking, was permitted by him to vilify the king, whether the abuse was actually begun by himself or caused by his incitement and provocation addressed to those who were his regular ministers in such matters.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">Thus started on their course they spent</s><s id="section33sent2">their days in the gymnasium jeering at the king and bringing out a succession of gibes against him.</s><s id="section33sent3">In fact they took the authors of farces and jests for their instructors</s><s id="section33sent4">and thereby showed their natural ability in things of shame, slow to be schooled in anything good but exceedingly quick and ready in learning the opposite.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">Why did Flaccus show no</s><s id="section34sent2">indignation?</s><s id="section34sent3">Why did he not arrest them?</s><s id="section34sent4">Why did he not chastise them for their presumptuous evil-speaking?</s><s id="section34sent5">Even if Agrippa had not been a king, yet as a member of Caesar’s household, did he not deserve to have some precedence and marks of honour?</s><s id="section34sent6">No, these are clear proofs that Flaccus was a party to the defamation.</s><s id="section34sent7">For it is evident that if he who could have chastised or at the very least stopped them did nothing to prevent them from acting in this way they did it with the full permission and consent of him himself.</s><s id="section34sent8">And if the undisciplined mob get a starting point for their misconduct in any</s><s id="section34sent9">direction, they do not halt there but pass on from one thing to another, always engaging in some fresh form of violence.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">There was a certain lunatic named Carabas,</s><s id="section35sent2">whose madness was not of the fierce and savage kind, which is dangerous both to the madmen themselves and those who approach them, but of the easy-going, gentler style.</s><s id="section35sent3">He spent day and night in the streets naked, shunning neither heat nor cold, made game of by the children and the lads who were idling about.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">The rioters drove the poor fellow into the gymnasium</s><s id="section36sent2">and set him up on high to be seen of all and put on his head a sheet of byblus spread out wide for a diadem, clothed the rest of his body with a rug for a royal robe, while someone who had noticed a piece of the native papyrus thrown away in the road gave it to him for his sceptre.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">And when as in some theatrical</s><s id="section37sent2">farce he had received the insignia of kingship and had been tricked out as a king, young men carrying rods on their shoulders as spearmen stood on either side of him in imitation of a bodyguard.</s><s id="section37sent3">Then others approached him, some pretending to salute him, others to sue for justice, others to consult him on state affairs.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">Then from the multitudes standing</s><s id="section38sent2">round him there rang out a tremendous shout hailing him as Marin,</s><s id="section38sent3">which is said to be the name for “lord” in Syria.</s><s id="section38sent4">For they knew that Agrippa was both a</s><s id="section38sent5">Syrian by birth and had a great piece of Syria over which he was king.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">When Flaccus heard, or rather</s><s id="section39sent2">saw all this, it was his duty to take and keep the madman in charge, to prevent him from providing an occasion to the railers for insulting their betters and then to punish those who had arrayed him thus, because they had dared both in word and deed both openly and indirectly to insult a king, a friend of Caesar’s, a person who had received Praetorian honours from the Roman Senate.</s><s id="section39sent3">Instead of this not merely did he refrain from chastising them but even shrank from restraining them, thereby giving immunity and free-play to those who displayed evil intentions and hostile feeling by pretending not to see what he saw nor hear what he heard.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">When</s><s id="section40sent2">the crowd perceived this, not the peaceful, public-spirited crowd, but the crowd which regularly fills everything with confusion and turmoil, which by its love of meddling, its eager pursuit of the worthless life, its habitual laziness and idling, is a thing that means mischief, they streamed into the theatre at early dawn, and having Flaccus purchased by the miserable price which he crazy for fame and ever-ready to be sold took to the destruction not only of himself but of the public safety, called out with one accord</s><s id="section40sent3">for installing images in the meeting-houses.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">What they proposed was a breach of the law entirely</s><s id="section41sent2">novel and unprecedented and knowing this, quick-witted as they are for villainy, they cunningly glozed it by using the name of Caesar as a screen, that name with which no guilty action can lawfully be associated.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">|</s><s id="section42sent2">What then did the governor</s><s id="section42sent3">of the country do?</s><s id="section42sent4">He knew that both Alexandria and the whole of Egypt had two kinds of inhabitants, us and them, and that there were no less than a million Jews resident in Alexandria and the country from the slope into Libya to the boundaries of Ethiopia; also that this was an attack against them all, and that ancestral customs cannot be disturbed without harm, yet he disregarded all these facts and permitted the installation of the images though there were a host of considerations all tending to caution which he might have set before them either as orders from a ruler or advice from a friend.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">But since he worked hand in hand with them</s><s id="section43sent2">in all their misdeeds he did not scruple to use his superior power to fan the flames of sedition perpetually by still more novel additions of evil, and as far as lay in his power filled, one may also say, the whole habitable world with racial conflict.</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">For it was perfectly</s><s id="section44sent2">clear that the rumour of the overthrowing</s><s id="section44sent3">of the synagogues beginning at Alexandria would spread at once to the nomes of Egypt and speed from Egypt to the East and the nations of the East and from the Hypotaenia</s><s id="section44sent4">and Marea, which are the outskirts of Libya, to the West and the nations of the West.</s></p></div>
