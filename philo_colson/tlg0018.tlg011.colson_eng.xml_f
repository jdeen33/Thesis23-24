On Drunkenness
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">The views expressed by the other philosophers</s><s id="section1sent2">on drunkenness have been stated by me to the best of my ability in the preceding book.</s><s id="section1sent3">Let us now consider what the great lawgiver in his never-failing wisdom holds on this subject.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">In many places of</s><s id="section2sent2">his legislation he mentions wine and the plant whose fruit it is—the vine.</s><s id="section2sent3">Some persons he permits, others he forbids, to drink of it, and sometimes he gives opposite orders,</s><s id="section2sent4">at one time enjoining and at another prohibiting its use to the same persons.</s><s id="section2sent5">These last are those who have made the great vow (Num. vi. 2), while those who are forbidden the use of strong drink are the ministering priests (Lev. x. 9); while of persons who take wine there are numberless instances among those whom he too holds in the highest admiration for their virtue.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">But before we begin to discuss these matters, we</s><s id="section3sent2">must carefully investigate the points which bear on our exposition.</s><s id="section3sent3">These points, I think, are the following.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Moses uses strong liquor as a symbol</s><s id="section4sent2">for more than one, in fact for several, things: for foolish talking and raving, for complete insensibility, for insatiable and ever-discontented greediness, for cheerfulness and gladness, for the nakedness which embraces the rest and manifests itself in all the</s><s id="section4sent3">qualities just mentioned,</s><s id="section4sent4">in which condition Noah was, we read, when intoxicated.</s><s id="section4sent5">All these we are told are produced by wine.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Yet thousands of those</s><s id="section5sent2">who never touch strong drink and consider themselves sober are mastered by similar emotions.</s><s id="section5sent3">We may see them in some cases mad and foolish, in others under the dominion of complete insensibility, in others never filled but always thirsting for impossibilities through lack of knowledge, or on the other hand full of gladness and exultation, finally in the true sense naked.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">The folly is caused by</s><s id="section6sent2">indiscipline in its noxious form, by which I mean not the mere unacquaintance with discipline but aversion to it; insensibility is caused by ignorance (always) blind and (often) with a will for evil</s><s id="section6sent3">; greediness by that most painful of the soul’s passions, lust; whizle gladness arises both from the winning and the practice of virtue.</s><s id="section6sent4">Nakedness has many causes: incapacity for distinguishing between moral opposites, innocence and simplicity of manners, truth, that is, the power which unveils</s><s id="section6sent5">what is wrapped in obscurity.</s><s id="section6sent6">At one moment it is virtue that she uncovers, at another vice in its turn.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">For we cannot</s><s id="section7sent2">doff both of these at the same moment any more than we can don them.</s><s id="section7sent3">When we discard the one we necessarily adopt and assume its opposite.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">The old story</s><s id="section8sent2">tells us that God when He fastened</s><s id="section8sent3">the naturally conflicting sensations of pleasure and</s><s id="section8sent4">pain under a single head, caused them to be felt at different times and not at the same moment, and thus decreed that the banishment of the one should involve the restoration of the other.</s><s id="section8sent5">Just in the same way, from a single root in our dominant part spring the two shoots of vice and virtue, yet never sprouting or bearing fruit at the same moment.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">For when one</s><s id="section9sent2">sheds its leaves and withers, its opposite begins to exhibit new life and verdure, so that we might suppose that each shrinks and shrivels in resentment at the thriving of the other.</s><s id="section9sent3">And so it is
in full agreement with philosophical truth that Moses represents the outgoing of Jacob as being the incoming of Esau.</s><s id="section9sent4">“It came to pass,” he says, “that as soon as Jacob went out Esau his brother came in”
(Gen. xxvii.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">30).</s><s id="section10sent2">For so long as prudence has its</s><s id="section10sent3">lodging and scene of action in the soul, so long is every friend of folly an outcast from her borders.</s><s id="section10sent4">But when prudence has changed her quarters, the other returns with glee now that the bitter enemy, who caused his expulsion and life of exile, no longer dwells where he did.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">So much then for what we may call the preliminaries</s><s id="section11sent2">of our treatise.</s><s id="section11sent3">I will now proceed to the demonstration of each head beginning with the first.</s><s id="section11sent4">Well, we agreed that indiscipline was the cause of folly and error, as wine when taken in large quantities is to so many foolish persons.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Indiscipline is</s><s id="section12sent2">indeed the prime cause of the soul’s errors, and from it as from a spring flow those actions of our lives which give to none any Sweet and salutary stream, but only briny waters fraught with plague and destruction to those who use them.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Thus it is against the untrained and undisciplined</s><s id="section13sent2">more perhaps than against any other person that the lawgiver breathes slaughter.</s><s id="section13sent3">Here is our proof.</s><s id="section13sent4">Who play the part of protectors not so much by acquired habit as by nature amongst humankind and every other kind of animal?</s><s id="section13sent5">Surely it is the parents.</s><s id="section13sent6">Not even a madman would give a different answer.</s><s id="section13sent7">For nature ever instinctively prompts the maker to care for what he has made, and to take thought for its preservation and perpetual maintenance.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Now when Moses set up those who would properly</s><s id="section14sent2">plead the cause of an offender, namely his father and mother, to appear as his accusers, thus providing that those who might be expected to preserve him against all others should actually work his ruin,</s><s id="section14sent3">he shewed his desire that these natural supporters should be converted into enemies.</s><s id="section14sent4">“For if anyone,” he says, “has a disobedient and contentious son who does not listen to the voice of his father and mother, and they discipline him and he does not hearken to them, his father and mother shall take him and bring him forth to the assembly of the elders of his city and to the gate of his place, and shall say to the men of their city, ‘This our son is disobedient and contentious, he does not listen to our voice, he is a riotous liver</s><s id="section14sent5">and a wine-bibber,’ and the men of the city shall stone him with stones and thou shalt remove the evil one from among yourselves” (Deut. xxi.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">18–21).</s><s id="section15sent2">We see then that the accusations</s><s id="section15sent3">are four in number, disobedience, contentiousness, participation in riotous feasting</s><s id="section15sent4">and drunkenness.</s><s id="section15sent5">But the last is the chief, rising to a climax from the first, disobedience.</s><s id="section15sent6">For when the soul has begun to cast off the reins and taken its onward</s><s id="section15sent7">course through strife and dissension, it reaches its utmost limit in drunkenness, which produces frenzy and madness.</s><s id="section15sent8">We must take these accusations one by one and observe their full meaning, beginning with the first.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">We have it as a clear and admitted fact that</s><s id="section16sent2">submission and obedience to virtue is noble and profitable, and the converse follows, that disobedience is disgraceful and in a high degree unprofitable.</s><s id="section16sent3">But if contentiousness is added to disobedience, it involves a vast increase of the evil.</s><s id="section16sent4">The disobedient man is not on so low a moral level as the quarrelsome and strife-loving man, since he merely disregards the commands he receives and nothing more, while the other takes active pains to carry out what is opposed to these commands.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">Let us consider how</s><s id="section17sent2">this shews itself.</s><s id="section17sent3">The law, to take one instance, bids us honour our parents; he then who does not honour them is disobedient, he who actively dishonours them is a strife-lover.</s><s id="section17sent4">Again, it is a righteous action to save one’s country.</s><s id="section17sent5">He who shirks this particular duty is to be classed as disobedient, he who actually purposes to betray it as a man of strife and contention.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">So too one who fails to do a kindness</s><s id="section18sent2">to his neighbour, in opposition to another who tells him that it is his duty to give help, is disobedient.</s><s id="section18sent3">But one who, besides withholding his kindness, works all the harm he can is moved by the spirit of strife to deadly error.</s><s id="section18sent4">And again the man who fails to make use of the holy rites and all else that relates to piety is disobedient to the commandments which law and custom regularly prescribe in these matters, but rebellious or strife-stirrer is the name for him who turns aside to their direct opposite, impiety, and</s><s id="section18sent5">becomes a leader in godlessness.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Such</s><s id="section19sent2">was he who said, “who is He that I should obey Him,”</s><s id="section19sent3">and again, “I know not the Lord” (Exod. v. 2).</s><s id="section19sent4">In the first of these utterances he asserts that there is no God; in the second that even if there is a God he is not known to us, and this conclusion presupposes the assumption that there is no divine providence.</s><s id="section19sent5">For if there were such a thing as providence, God too would be known.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">As for contributions or club subscriptions, when</s><s id="section20sent2">the object is to share in the best of possessions, prudence, such payments are praiseworthy and profitable; but when they are paid to obtain that supreme evil, folly, the practice is unprofitable and blameworthy.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">We contribute to the former object by desire for</s><s id="section21sent2">virtue, by zeal for things noble, by continuous study therein, by persistent self-training, by unwearied and unflagging labour.</s><s id="section21sent3">We contribute to the opposite by slackness, indolence, luxury, effeminacy, and by complete irregularity of life.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">We can see indeed</s><s id="section22sent2">people preparing themselves to compete in the arena of wine-bibbing and every day exercising themselves and contending in the contests of gluttony.</s><s id="section22sent3">The contributions they make are supposed to be for a profitable purpose, but they are actually mulcting themselves in everything, in money, body and soul.</s><s id="section22sent4">Their substance they diminish by the actual payments, their bodily powers they shatter and enfeeble by the delicate living, and by excessive indulgence in food they deluge their souls as with a winter torrent and submerge them perforce in the depths.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">In just the same way those who pay their contributions</s><s id="section23sent2">only to destroy training and education are mulcting their most vital element, the understanding,</s><s id="section23sent3">and cut away therefrom its safeguards, prudence and self-control, and indeed courage and justice to boot.</s><s id="section23sent4">It was for this reason, I think, that Moses himself used a compound word, “contribution cutting,” to bring out more clearly the nature of the thing he was describing, because when men bring their efforts like contributions or club-money, so to speak, to bear against virtue, they wound and divide and cut in pieces docile and knowledge-loving souls, till they bring them to utter destruction.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">Thus we read that the wise Abraham returned from</s><s id="section24sent2">the “cutting”</s><s id="section24sent3">of Chedorlaomer and his fellow kings (Gen. xiv. 17), while on the other hand Amalek “cuts the rearguard” of the Practiser (Deut. xxv. 18).</s><s id="section24sent4">Both these are in accordance with natural truth, for there is a hostility between opposites and they are always meditating destruction of each other.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">There is another charge, and that the greatest, which</s><s id="section25sent2">could be brought against the provider of the contributions.</s><s id="section25sent3">He purposes not only to wrong, but to join with others in wrongdoing.</s><s id="section25sent4">He consents to initiate evil himself, and also to comply with what others initiate, that thus he may leave himself no ray of hope that may serve for his redemption, since his sin lies both in his nature and in what he has learnt from others.</s><s id="section25sent5">And this in spite of the direct injunction of the law, not “to go with the many to do evil” (Exod. xxiii.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">2).</s><s id="section26sent2">For in very truth manifold</s><s id="section26sent3">are the aspects and the products of evil in men’s souls, while the good is narrowly confined and scanty.</s><s id="section26sent4">And so most excellent is the advice that we should not keep company with the many but with the few; for wrongdoing is the associate of the former, but right action of the latter.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">The fourth and greatest charge was that of</s><s id="section27sent2">drunkenness—and drunkenness not of the milder but of the most intense sort.</s><s id="section27sent3">For the phrase here used, “fired with wine,”</s><s id="section27sent4">is as much as to say that the poison which causes folly, indiscipline, smoulders within the man, then bursts into fire and flame impossible to quench, and consumes the soul through its whole being with the conflagration.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">Naturally,</s><s id="section28sent2">therefore, will punishment follow, purging every base tendency out of the mind.</s><s id="section28sent3">For it says, “thou shalt remove the evil one,” not out of a city or a country or a nation but “out of yourselves” (Deut. xxi. 21).</s><s id="section28sent4">For it is in ourselves that the vicious and culpable thoughts exist and have their lair, thoughts which we must cut away and destroy when their state is incurable.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">We see then this man as disobedient,</s><s id="section29sent2">as strife-loving, as providing in the form of persuasive arguments “contributions” and “club-money” for the subversion of morality, and finally inflamed with strong drink and making drunken assaults on virtue and directing his monstrous orgies against her.</s><s id="section29sent3">Surely it were just that such a one as he should find his accusers in those in whom others find their allies, namely in his father and mother, and be visited with complete destruction, to admonish and bring to their senses those who can be saved.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Now “father and mother” is a phrase which can</s><s id="section30sent2">bear different meanings.</s><s id="section30sent3">For instance we should rightly say and without further question that the Architect who made this universe was at the same time the father of what was thus born, whilst its mother was the knowledge possessed by its Maker.</s><s id="section30sent4">With His knowledge God had union, not as men have it, and begat created being.</s><s id="section30sent5">And knowledge, having received the divine seed, when her travail was consummated bore the only beloved son who is apprehended by the senses,</s><s id="section30sent6">the world which we see.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Thus</s><s id="section31sent2">in the pages of one of the inspired company, wisdom is represented as speaking of herself after this manner: “God obtained</s><s id="section31sent3">me first of all his works and founded me before the ages” (Prov. viii. 22).</s><s id="section31sent4">True, for it was necessary that all that came to the birth of creation should be younger than the mother and nurse of the All.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">If these parents accuse, who</s><s id="section32sent2">is able to withstand their accusation, or even a mild threat or the lightest chiding?</s><s id="section32sent3">Why, even their gifts are so boundless in number that no one, not even, one may say, the world, can contain them, but like some small cistern it wall quickly be filled to the brim by the influx from the fountain of God’s gracious boons, and discharge the rest in an overflow.</s><s id="section32sent4">And if we are unable to contain their benefits, how shall we endure the visitation of their powers to chastise?</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">But in the present discussion,</s><s id="section33sent2">we must leave out of consideration the parents of the universe, and rather turn our eyes to the disciples, who have followed in their company,</s><s id="section33sent3">to whom has been committed the care and guidance of such souls as are not without training or incapable of culture.</s><s id="section33sent4">I suggest, then, that the father is reason, masculine, perfect, right reason and the mother the lower learning of the schools, with its regular course or round of instruction.</s><s id="section33sent5">These two stand to us in the relation of parents to children, and it is good and profitable to obey them.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">Now right reason, the father, bids us follow in the</s><s id="section34sent2">steps of nature and pursue truth in her naked and undisguised form.</s><s id="section34sent3">Education, the mother, bids us give ear to rules laid down by human ordinance, rules which have been made in different cities and countries and nations by those who first embraced the apparent</s><s id="section34sent4">in preference to the true.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">These</s><s id="section35sent2">parents have four classes of children.</s><s id="section35sent3">The first is obedient to both; the second is the direct opposite, and gives heed to neither, while each of the other two lacks its half.</s><s id="section35sent4">One of them is heartily devoted to the father and gives ear to him, but disregards the mother and her injunctions.</s><s id="section35sent5">The other, on the contrary, appears devoted to the mother, and serves her in every way, but pays no heed to the words of the father.</s><s id="section35sent6">Of these four the first will carry off the palm of victory over all comers, while the second its opposite will receive defeat accompanied by destruction.</s><s id="section35sent7">Each of the others will claim a prize, one the second, the other the third; the second belongs to the class which obeys the father, the third to the class which obeys the mother.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">This last kind which loves the mother, which</s><s id="section36sent2">bows down to the opinions of the multitude and undergoes all manner of transformations in conformity with the ever-varying aspirations of human life, like the Egyptian Proteus, whose true form remained a matter of uncertainty through his power to become everything in the universe, is most clearly typified by Jethro.</s><s id="section36sent3">Jethro is a compound of vanity, closely corresponding with a city or commonwealth peopled by a promiscuous horde, who swing to and fro as their idle opinions carry them.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">See how he deals</s><s id="section37sent2">with Moses.</s><s id="section37sent3">He in his wisdom was recalling the whole people of the soul to piety and to honouring</s><s id="section37sent4">God, and was teaching them the commandments and holy laws.</s><s id="section37sent5">His words are, “when they have a dispute and come to me, I judge between each of them and instruct them in the commandments of God and His law” (Exod. xviii. 16).</s><s id="section37sent6">And then comes forward Jethro the seeming wise, who has never learnt the secrets of the divine blessings, but his concern has been with little else than things human and corruptible.</s><s id="section37sent7">He plays the demagogue, and the laws which he lays down contradict the laws of nature; for his eyes are fixed on semblance, while they relate to real existence.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">Yet even on him Moses has compassion,</s><s id="section38sent2">and pities him for his great delusion; he feels that he should teach him a better lesson, and persuade him to depart from his empty opinions and follow truth stedfastly.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">We have “removed,”</s><s id="section39sent2">he</s><s id="section39sent3">says in effect, and excised from the mind its empty vanity and are passing over to the place of knowledge, which is ours through the oracles and promises of God.</s><s id="section39sent4">“Come with us and we will do thee good”
(Num. x. 29).</s><s id="section39sent5">For you will lose the most harmful of evils, mere seeming, and gain the most profitable of blessings, truth.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">But even to words of such charm</s><s id="section40sent2">as these Jethro will pay no heed, nor ever follow knowledge in any way, but will hasten to return to the empty vanity which is indeed his own.</s><s id="section40sent3">For we read that he said to Moses, “I will not go, but I will go to my land and my generation” (Num. x. 30); that is, to the unfaith of false opinion which is his kinsman, since he has not learnt the true faith, so dear to real men.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">For when he</s><s id="section41sent2">wishes to make a shew of piety and says “now I</s><s id="section41sent3">know that the Lord is great beyond all the gods” (Exod. xviii. 11), he does but charge himself with impiety in the eyes of men who knew how to judge.</s><s id="section41sent4">They will say to him “Blasphemer!</s></p></div>
