On Husbandry
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he 1 planted a vineyard, and drank of the wine, and became drunken within his house</s><s id="section1sent2">” (Gen. ix. 20 f.).</s><s id="section1sent3">Most men, not knowing the nature of things, necessarily go wrong also in giving them names.</s><s id="section1sent4">For things which are well considered and subjected as it were to dissection have appropriate designations attached to them in consequence; while others having been presented in a confused state receive names that are not thoroughly accurate.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">Moses, being abundantly</s><s id="section2sent2">equipped with the knowledge that has to do with things, is in the habit of using names that are perfectly apt and expressive.</s><s id="section2sent3">We shall find the assurance just given made good in many parts of the Lawgiving, and not least in the section before us in which the righteous Noah is introduced as a husbandman.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">Would not anyone who answers questions offhand</s><s id="section3sent2">think that husbandry and working on the soil were the same things, although in reality they not only are not the same things, but are ideas utterly at variance with each other and mutually repugnant?</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">For a man is able even without knowledge to labour</s><s id="section4sent2">at the care of the soil, but a husbandman is guaranteed to be no unprofessional, but a skilled worker by his very name, which he has gained from the science of husbandry, the science whose title he bears.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">In</s><s id="section5sent2">addition to this there is the further point to be considered, that the worker on the soil is as a rule a wage-earner, and as such has but one end in view, his wages, and cares nothing at all about doing his work well; whereas the husbandman would be willing not only to put into the undertaking much of his private property, but to spend a further amount drawn from his domestic budget, to do the farm good and to escape being blamed by those who have seen it.</s><s id="section5sent3">For, regardless of gain from any other source, he desires only to see the crops which he has grown yielding plentifully year by year and to take up their produce.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Such a man will be anxious to bring under</s><s id="section6sent2">cultivation the trees that were before wild, to improve by careful treatment those already under cultivation, to check by pruning those that are over-luxuriant owing to excess of nourishment, to give more scope to those which have been curtailed and kept back, splicing on new growths to stem or branch; when trees of good kinds throw out abundant tendrils, he will like to train them under ground in shallow trenches; and to improve such as yield poor crops by inserting grafts into the stem near the roots and joining them with it so that they grow together as one.</s><s id="section6sent3">The same thing happens, I may remark, in the case of men, when adopted sons become by reason of their native good qualities congenial to those who by birth are aliens from them, and so become firmly fitted into the family.</s><s id="section6sent4">To return to our subject.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">The</s><s id="section7sent2">husbandman will pull up by the roots and throw away quantities of trees on which the shoots that should bear fruit have lost their fertility, and so, because they have been planted near them, have done great harm to those that are bearing fruit.</s><s id="section7sent3">The science,</s><s id="section7sent4">then, that has to do with growths that spring out of the earth is of the kind I have described.</s><s id="section7sent5">Let us consider in its turn soul-husbandry.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">First, then, it makes it its aim to sow or plant</s><s id="section8sent2">nothing that has no produce, but all that is fitted for cultivation and fruit-bearing, and likely to yield yearly tributes to man, its prince; for him did nature appoint to be ruler of all trees as well as of the living creatures besides himself that are mortal.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">But who else could the man that is in each of us be</s><s id="section9sent2">save the mind, whose place it is to reap the benefits derived from all that has been sown or planted?</s><s id="section9sent3">But seeing that for babes milk is food, but for grown men wheaten bread, there must also be soul-nourishment, such as is milk-like suited to the time of childhood, in the shape of the preliminary stages of school-learning, and such as is adapted to grown men in the shape of instructions leading the way through wisdom and temperance and all virtue.</s><s id="section9sent4">For these when sown and planted in the mind will produce most beneficial fruits, namely fair and praiseworthy conduct.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">By means of this husbandry whatever trees</s><s id="section10sent2">of passions or vices have sprung up and grown tall, bearing mischief-dealing fruits, are cut down and cleared away, no minute portion even being allowed to survive, as the germ of new growths of sins to spring up later on.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">And should there be any trees</s><s id="section11sent2">capable of bearing neither wholesome nor harmful fruits, these it will cut down indeed, but not allow them to be made away with, but assign them to a use for which they are suited, setting them as pales and stakes to surround an encampment or to fence in a city in place of a wall.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">For he says, “Every</s><s id="section12sent2">tree whose fruit is not edible thou shalt cut down and</s><s id="section12sent3">shalt make into a palisade to resist the city, which shall make war against thee” (Deut. xx. 20).</s><s id="section12sent4">The Scripture uses these trees to represent the purely intellectual activities which deal with theory alone.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Among these we must place medical science dissociated</s><s id="section13sent2">from practical measures such as lead to the recovery of the sick; the kind of oratory practised by the hired advocate, that is concerned not to find out the rights of the case, but to influence the hearers by falsehood; and over and above these we must include all the modes of reaching conclusions by argumentative and rigidly deductive processes,</s><s id="section13sent3">that contribute nothing to the improvement of character,</s><s id="section13sent4">but whet the mind, compelling it to pay keen attention to each problem as it presents itself; and enabling it to draw clear distinctions, and to make the special character of the matter in hand stand out in bold relief against the background of the features which it has in common with others.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Accordingly, they tell</s><s id="section14sent2">us that the men of old likened philosophic discussion with its threefold division</s><s id="section14sent3">to a field, comparing that part which deals with nature to trees and plants; that which deals with morality to fruits and crops, for the sake of which the plants exist; that part which has to do with logic to a fence enclosing it.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">For even as the wall built round it serves to protect</s><s id="section15sent2">the fruit and the plants that grow in the field, keeping off those who would like mischievously to make their way in with a view to plunder; in the same way the logical part of philosophy is, so to speak, a strong barrier guarding those other two parts, the ethical and the physical.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">For when it disentangles ambiguous</s><s id="section16sent2">expressions capable of two meanings, and exposes the fallacies created by tricks of argument, and using</s><s id="section16sent3">perfectly clear and unmistakable language and adducing proofs which admit of no doubt destroys plausible falsehood, that greatest snare and pest of the soul, it makes the mind like smoothed wax ready to receive the impressions made by the science that explores existence and that which aims at building character, impressions free from flaw and aught that is not genuine.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">These, then, are the offers held out by soul-husbandry</s><s id="section17sent2">in its inaugural proclamation: “The trees of folly and licentiousness, of injustice and cowardice I will wholly cut down; I will moreover extirpate the plants of pleasure and desire, of anger and wrath and of like passions, even though they be grown up to heaven; I will burn up their very roots, letting the rush of fire pursue them even to the depths of the earth, that no part or trace or shadow of them whatever be left behind.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">These I will destroy, but</s><s id="section18sent2">I will plant for souls in their childhood suckers whose fruit shall feed them.</s><s id="section18sent3">These suckers are the learning to write easily and read fluently; the diligent search of what wise poets have written; geometry and the practice of rhetorical composition; and the whole of the education embraced in school-learning.</s><s id="section18sent4">For souls at the stage of youths and of those now growing into men I will provide the better and more perfect thing suited to their age, the plant of sound sense, that of courage, that of temperance, that of justice, that of all virtue.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">If, again, some tree among those</s><s id="section19sent2">that belong to what is called wild wood does not bear edible fruit, but can be a fence and protection of such fruit, this tree also will I keep in store, not for its own sake, but because it is adapted to do service to another that is indispensable and most useful.”</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">It is for this reason that Moses, the all-wise,</s><s id="section20sent2">ascribes to the righteous man soul-husbandry as a science in keeping with him and rightly pertaining to him, saying “Noah began to be a husbandman,”
whereas to the unrighteous man he ascribes that working of the ground which is without scientific knowledge and carries very heavy loads.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">For he</s><s id="section21sent2">says, “Cain was one working the ground” (Gen. iv. 2), and, a little later, when he is discovered to have incurred</s><s id="section21sent3">the pollution of fratricide, it is said: “Cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand, with which thou shalt work the ground, and it shall not yield</s><s id="section21sent4">its strength to give it thee” (Gen. iv. 12 f.).</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">How, I ask, could anyone shew more clearly</s><s id="section22sent2">than in this manner that the lawgiver considers the bad man a worker of the soil and not an husbandman?</s><s id="section22sent3">We must not, however, suppose that what is here spoken of is either a man able to work with hands and feet and the other powers of the body, or that it is soil on hill or plain.</s><s id="section22sent4">No, the subject dealt with is the faculties of each one of us; for the soul of the bad man has no other interest than his earthy body, and all the body’s pleasures.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">At all events</s><s id="section23sent2">the majority of mankind traversing all the quarters of the earth and finding their way to its utmost bounds, and crossing its oceans, and seeking what is hidden in far-reaching creeks of the sea, and leaving no part of the whole world unexplored, are always and everywhere procuring the means of increasing pleasure.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">For even as fishermen let down nets,</s><s id="section24sent2">sometimes very long, taking in a large extent of sea,</s><s id="section24sent3">in order that they may enclose within the toils as many fish as possible imprisoned as though by a wall: in just the same fashion the larger part of mankind stretching what the poets call, I think, “all-capturing
nets,” not only over every part of the sea but over the whole realm of water, earth and air, ensnares from all quarters things of all sorts to satisfy and indulge Pleasure.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">They dig into the ground and</s><s id="section25sent2">cross the seas and do all works incidental to war or peace to provide lavish materials for Pleasure as for a queen.</s><s id="section25sent3">These people have not learned the secrets of soul-husbandry, which sows and plants the virtues and reaps as their fruit a happy life.</s><s id="section25sent4">They have made the objects dear to the flesh their business,</s><s id="section25sent5">and these they pursue methodically.</s><s id="section25sent6">With all earnestness they seek to make their own that composition of clay, that moulded statue, that house so close to the soul, which it never lays aside but carries as a corpse from birth to death, ah! how sore a burden!</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">We have stated how working of the soil differs</s><s id="section26sent2">from husbandry and a worker of the soil from an husbandman.</s><s id="section26sent3">But we must consider whether there are not other cases like those which have been mentioned, in which the difference between the things signified is obscured by their passing under the same name.</s><s id="section26sent4">There are two such instances which we have found by careful search, and concerning which we will say, if we can, what ought to be said.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">For example, then, as in the case of “husbandman”</s><s id="section27sent2">and “soil-worker,” by resorting to allegory we found a wide difference in meaning to underly apparent</s><s id="section27sent3">identity, so shall we find it to be with “shepherd”
and “cattle-rearer.”</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">For the lawgiver speaks in some places of “cattle-rearing,” in others of “shepherding,” and people who have not acquired real</s><s id="section28sent2">accuracy will perhaps suppose that these are synonymous descriptions of the same pursuit, whereas they denote different things when words are rendered in the light of their deeper meaning.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">For though it is</s><s id="section29sent2">customary to apply to those who have charge of animals both names, calling them “cattle-rearers” and “shepherds” indiscriminately, yet we may not do so when we are speaking of the reasoning faculty to which the flock of the soul has been entrusted: for this ruler of a flock is called a “cattle-rearer” when he is a bad ruler, but, when a good and sterling one, he receives the name of “shepherd.”</s><s id="section29sent3">How this is, we will at once shew.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Nature has produced</s><s id="section30sent2">each one of us with “cattle” as part of our being.</s><s id="section30sent3">The living soul puts forth, as it were, from one root two shoots, one of which has been left whole and undivided and is called “Mind,” while the other by a sixfold division is made into seven growths, five those of the senses and (two) of two other organs, that of utterance and that of generation.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">All this</s><s id="section31sent2">herd being irrational is compared to cattle, and by nature’s law a herd cannot do without a governor.</s><s id="section31sent3">Now when a man at once without experience in ruling and possessed of wealth rises up and constitutes himself a ruler, he becomes the author of a multitude of evils to his charges.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">For he on his</s><s id="section32sent2">part supplies provender lavishly, and the animals gorging themselves beyond measure wax wanton from abundance of food, wantonness being the true offspring of excess, and in their wantonness they</s><s id="section32sent3">become frolicsome and refuse to be controlled, and getting separated in scattered groups they break up the compact array of the flock.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">The erstwhile</s><s id="section33sent2">ruler, forsaken by his subjects, is shewn to be a raw hand, and runs after them anxious if possible to get hold of some animal and bring it under control again.</s><s id="section33sent3">Finding that he cannot do this, he weeps and groans, cursing his own rashness, and blaming himself for what has happened.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">Precisely in this way does that</s><s id="section34sent2">other herd, our senses, act; whenever the mind gets lazy and careless, they gorge themselves insatiably with the lavish food brought in by the objects of sense, shake off restraint, and get unruly, going at random where they have no business to go.</s><s id="section34sent3">The eyes wide open to all things visible, even those which it is not right to look upon, meet with disaster.</s><s id="section34sent4">The ears welcome all sounds and are never satisfied; they are athirst all the time for particulars about other people’s business, in some cases for topics for vulgar jesting, and go far and wide on these errands.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">VIII, From</s><s id="section35sent2">what other quarter can we suppose that the theatres all over the world are filled every day with countless myriads?</s><s id="section35sent3">Those whom spectacles and musical performances have made their slaves, allowing ears and eyes to wander about unbridled; taken up with flute-players and harpers and the whole range of unmanly and effeminate music; delighting in dancers and other actors, because they put themselves into indelicate positions and make indelicate movements; ever organizing a warfare as mimic as that on the stage</s><s id="section35sent4">without a thought for their own betterment or</s><s id="section35sent5">for that of the commonweal, but overthrowing (the poor wretches!), by means of eyes and ears their own life itself.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Others there are more miserable</s><s id="section36sent2">and ill-starred than these, who have let loose their appetite like an animal which had been tied up.</s><s id="section36sent3">Thus left at large it at once makes for all kinds of enjoyment of eatables and drinkables, takes its pick of what has already been served up, and develops a ceaseless and insatiable craving for what is not on the table.</s><s id="section36sent4">So, even if the receptacles of the belly have been completely filled, taste still empty and still swelling and panting goes about looking everywhere to see whether haply there are any leavings that have been overlooked and let pass, that like an all-devouring fire it may pick up this as well.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">Gluttony</s><s id="section37sent2">is naturally followed by her attendant, sexual indulgence, bringing on extraordinary madness, fierce desire and most grievous frenzy.</s><s id="section37sent3">For when men have been loaded up with overeating and strong drink and heavy intoxication, they are no longer able to control themselves, but in haste to indulge their lusts they carry on their revels and beset doors until they have drained off the great vehemence of their passion and find it possible to be still.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">This is</s><s id="section38sent2">apparently the reason why Nature placed the organs of sexual lust where she did, assuming that they do not like hunger, but are roused to their special activities when fulness of food leads the way.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">So we must give the name of cattle-rearers to</s><s id="section39sent2">those who permit these creatures to gorge themselves wholesale with all that they crave after.</s><s id="section39sent3">The title of shepherds we must give on the other hand to such as supply them with the necessaries of life only and nothing more, pruning and cutting off all excessive</s><s id="section39sent4">and hurtful luxuriance, a thing which does no less harm than straitness and dearth.</s><s id="section39sent5">“Shepherds” too are those who exercise much forethought that the flock may not contract disease as the result of negligence and laziness, praying too that there may be no occurrence of such plagues as are wont to come as a visitation which cannot be guarded against.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">No less</s><s id="section40sent2">do they make it their aim that the flock may not be broken up and scattered about.</s><s id="section40sent3">Fear is the corrector of those who never obey reason.</s><s id="section40sent4">This they hold over them, and have recourse to constant punishment, a mild form in the case of those whose rebellion is capable of being cured, but very severe in the case of those whose wrongdoings defy curative treatment.</s><s id="section40sent5">For that which is apparently much to be deprecated is a very great boon to people who act senselessly, just as physic is to people in bad bodily health.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">These are the practices and ways of shepherds,</s><s id="section41sent2">who prefer what is distasteful but beneficial to what is pleasant but hurtful.</s><s id="section41sent3">So full of dignity and benefit has the shepherd’s task been held to be, that poets are wont to give to kings the title of “shepherds of peoples,” a title which the lawgiver bestows on the wise.</s><s id="section41sent4">They are the only real kings,</s><s id="section41sent5">and he shews them to us ruling, as a shepherd does his flock, over the irrational tendency common to all mankind.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">This is why he ascribed to Jacob, who was perfected</s><s id="section42sent2">as the result of discipline, the shepherd’s lore.</s><s id="section42sent3">For Jacob tends the sheep of Laban (Gen. xxx. 36), that is to say, of the soul of the foolish one which considers nothing good but sensible objects that meet the eye, and which is deceived and enslaved by colours and shadows; for the meaning of “Laban” is “whitening.”</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">He ascribes the same profession to Moses, the</s><s id="section43sent2">all-wise; for he also is appointed shepherd of a mind that welcomes conceit in preference to truth, and approves seeming in preference to being.</s><s id="section43sent3">For “Jethro” or “Iothor” means “uneven,</s><s id="section43sent4">” and self-conceit is an uneven and adventitious thing that comes in to beguile a fixed and steady life.</s><s id="section43sent5">It is a quality whose way is to introduce principles of right varying city by city; of one kind in this city, of another kind in that; not the same rule of right in all.</s><s id="section43sent6">The ordinances of nature that apply to all alike and are immovable it has never seen even in a dream.</s><s id="section43sent7">What we are told is that “Moses was shepherding the sheep of Jethro the priest of Midian” (Exod. iii.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">1).
