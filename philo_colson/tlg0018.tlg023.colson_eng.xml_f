The Decalogue
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">Having related in the preceding treatises the</s><s id="section1sent2">lives of those whom Moses judged to be men of wisdom, who are set before us in the Sacred Books as founders of our nation and in themselves unwritten laws,</s><s id="section1sent3">I shall now proceed in due course to give full descriptions of the written laws.</s><s id="section1sent4">And if some allegorical interpretation should appear to underlie them, I shall not fail to state it.</s><s id="section1sent5">For knowledge loves to learn and advance to full understanding</s><s id="section1sent6">and its way is to seek the hidden meaning rather than the obvious.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">To the question why he promulgated his laws in</s><s id="section2sent2">the depths of the desert instead of in cities we may answer in the first place that most cities are full of countless evils, both acts of impiety towards God and wrongdoing between man and man.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">For everything</s><s id="section3sent2">is debased, the genuine overpowered by the spurious, the true by the specious, which is intrinsically false but creates impressions whose plausibility serves but to delude.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">So too in cities there arises</s><s id="section4sent2">that most insidious of foes, Pride</s><s id="section4sent3">admired and worshipped by some who add dignity to vain ideas</s><s id="section4sent4">by means of gold crowns and purple robes and a</s><s id="section4sent5">great establishment of servants and cars, on which these so-called blissful and happy people ride aloft, drawn sometimes by mules and horses, sometimes by men, who bear the heavy burden on their shoulders, yet suffer in soul rather than in body under the weight of extravagant arrogance.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">Pride is also the creator of many other evils,</s><s id="section5sent2">boastfulness, haughtiness, inequality, and these are the sources of wars, both civil and foreign, suffering no place to remain in peace whether public or private, whether on sea or on land.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Yet why</s><s id="section6sent2">dwell on offences between man and man?</s><s id="section6sent3">Pride also brings divine things into utter contempt, even though they are supposed to receive the highest honours.</s><s id="section6sent4">But what honour can there be if truth be not there as well, truth honourable both in name and function, just as falsehood is naturally dishonourable?</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">This</s><s id="section7sent2">contempt for things divine is manifest to those of keener vision.</s><s id="section7sent3">For men have employed sculpture and painting to fashion innumerable forms which they have enclosed in shrines and temples and after building altars have assigned celestial and divine honours to idols of stone and wood and suchlike images, all of them lifeless things.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">Such persons are happily</s><s id="section8sent2">compared in the sacred Scriptures to the children of a harlot</s><s id="section8sent3">; for as they in their ignorance of their one natural father ascribe their paternity to all their mother’s lovers, so too throughout the cities those who do not know the true, the really existent God have deified hosts of others who are falsely so called.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">Then as some honour one, some another god, diversity</s><s id="section9sent2">of opinion as to which was best waxed strong and engendered disputes in every other matter also.</s><s id="section9sent3">This was the primary consideration which made him prefer to legislate away from cities.</s><s id="section9sent4">He had also a second object in mind.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">He who is about</s><s id="section10sent2">to receive the holy laws must first cleanse his soul and purge away the deep-set stains which it has contracted through contact with the motley promiscuous horde of men in cities.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">And to this he cannot attain</s><s id="section11sent2">except by dwelling apart, nor that at once, but only long afterwards, and not till the marks which his old transgressions have imprinted on him have gradually grown faint, melted away and disappeared.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">In this</s><s id="section12sent2">way too good physicians preserve their sick folk: they think it unadvisable to give them food or drink until they have removed the causes of their maladies.</s><s id="section12sent3">While these still remain, nourishment is useless, indeed harmful, and acts as fuel to the distemper.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Naturally therefore he first led them away from</s><s id="section13sent2">the highly mischievous associations of cities into the desert, to clear the sins out of their souls, and then began to set the nourishment before their minds—and what should this nourishment be but laws and words of God?</s><s id="section13sent3">He had a third reason as follows:</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">just as men</s><s id="section14sent2">when setting out on a long voyage do not begin to provide sails and rudders and tillers when they have embarked and left the harbour, but equip themselves with enough of the gear needed for the voyage while they are still staying on shore, so Moses did not think it good that they should just take their portions and settle in cities and then go in quest of laws to regulate their civic life, but rather should first provide themselves with the rules for that life and gain practice</s><s id="section14sent3">in all that would surely enable the communities to steer their course in safety, and then settle down to follow from the first the principles of justice lying ready for their use, in harmony and fellowship of spirit and rendering to every man his due.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">Some too give a fourth reason which is not out</s><s id="section15sent2">of keeping with the truth but agrees very closely with it.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">As it was necessary to establish a belief in their minds that the laws were not the inventions of a man but quite clearly the oracles of God, he led the nation a great distance away from cities into the depths of a desert, barren not only of cultivated fruits but also of water fit for drinking, in order that,</s><s id="section16sent2">if after lacking the necessaries of life and expecting to perish from hunger and thirst they suddenly found abundance of sustenance self-produced—when heaven rained the food called manna and the shower of quails from the air to add relish to their food—when the bitter water grew sweet and fit for drinking and springs gushed out of the steep</s><s id="section16sent3">rock—they should no longer wonder whether the laws were actually the pronouncements of God, since they had been given the clearest evidence of the truth in the supplies which they had so unexpectedly received in their destitution.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">For</s><s id="section17sent2">He who gave abundance of the means</s><s id="section17sent3">of life also bestowed the wherewithal of a good life; for mere life they needed food and drink which they found without making provision; for the good life</s><s id="section17sent4">they needed laws and ordinances which would bring improvement to their souls.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">These are the reasons suggested to answer the</s><s id="section18sent2">question under discussion: they are but probable surmises; the true reasons are know to God alone.</s><s id="section18sent3">Having said what was fitting on this subject, I will proceed to describe the laws themselves in order, with this necessary statement by way of introduction, that some of them God judged fit to deliver in His own person alone without employing any other, and some through His prophet Moses whom</s><s id="section18sent4">He chose as of all men the best suited to be the revealer of verities.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Now we find that those which</s><s id="section19sent2">He gave in His own person and by His own mouth alone include both laws and heads summarizing the particular laws, but those in which He spoke through the prophet all belong to the former class.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">I will</s><s id="section20sent2">deal with both to the best of my ability, taking those which are rather of the nature of summaries first.</s><s id="section20sent3">Here our admiration is at once aroused by their number, which is neither more nor less than is the supremely perfect,</s><s id="section20sent4">Ten.</s><s id="section20sent5">Ten contains all different kinds of numbers,</s><s id="section20sent6">even as 2, odd as 3, and even-odd as 6, and all ratios, whether of a number to its multiples or fractional, when a number is either increased or diminished by some part of itself.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">So too it contains all the analogies or progressions, the</s><s id="section21sent2">arithmetical where each term in the series is greater</s><s id="section21sent3">than the one below and less than the one above by the same amount,</s><s id="section21sent4">as for example 1 2 3; the geometrical where the ratio of the second to the first term is the same as that of the third to the second, as with 1 2 4, and this is seen whether the ratio is double or treble or any multiple, or again fractional as 3 to 2, 4 to 3, and the like; once more the harmonic in which the middle term exceeds and is exceeded by the extremes on either side by the same fraction, as is the case with 3, 4, 6.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">Ten</s><s id="section22sent2">also contains the properties observed in triangles, quadrilaterals and other polygons, and also those of the concords, the fourth, fifth, octave and double octave intervals, where the ratios are respectively 1 1/3, i.e. 4: 3, 1 ½, i.e. 3: 2, doubled, i.e. 2: 1, fourfold, i.e. 8: 2.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">Consequently it seems to me that those</s><s id="section23sent2">who first gave names to things did reasonably, wise men that they were, in giving it the name of decad, as being the dechad, or receiver, because it receives and has made room for every kind of number and numerical ratio and progressions and also concords and harmonies.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">VII, But indeed apart</s><s id="section24sent2">from what has been said, the decad may reasonably be admired because it embraces Nature as seen both with and without extension in space.</s><s id="section24sent3">Nature exists without extension nowhere except in the point; with extension in three forms, line, surface, solid.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">For space as limited by two points is a line, but,</s><s id="section25sent2">where there are two dimensions, we have a surface,</s><s id="section25sent3">as the line has expanded into breadth; where there are three, we have a solid, as length and breadth have acquired depth, and here Nature comes to a halt, for she has not produced more than three dimensions.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">All these have numbers for their archetypes,</s><s id="section26sent2">1 for the non-extended point, 2 for the line, 3 for the surface, 4 for the solid, and these one, two, three, four added together make the ten which gives a glimpse of other beauties also to those who have eyes to see.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">For we may say that the infinite series</s><s id="section27sent2">of numbers is measured by ten, because its constituent terms are the four, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the same terms produce the hundred out of the tens, since 10, 20, 30, 40 make a hundred, and similarly the thousand is produced out of the hundreds and the ten thousand or myriad out of the thousands, and these, the unit, the ten, the hundred and the thousand are the four starting-points from each of which springs a ten.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">And again, this same ten, apart from what has already</s><s id="section28sent2">been said, reveals other differences in numbers; the order of prime numbers divisible by the unit alone having for its pattern three, five, seven: the square, that is four, the cube, eight, the products respectively of two and three equal numbers, and the perfect number six equal to the sum</s><s id="section28sent3">of its factors 3, 2 and 1.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">But why enumerate the</s><s id="section29sent2">virtues of Ten, which are infinite in number, and thus treat perfunctorily a task of supreme greatness which by itself is found to be an all-sufficing subject for</s><s id="section29sent3">students of mathematics?</s><s id="section29sent4">But while we
must leave unnoticed the rest, there is one which may without impropriety be mentioned as a sample.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Those who study the doctrines of philosophy say</s><s id="section30sent2">that the categories</s><s id="section30sent3">in nature, as they are called, are ten only, substance, quality, quantity, relation, activity, passivity, state, position and the indispensables
for all existence, time and place.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">There</s><s id="section31sent2">is nothing which does not participate in these categories.</s><s id="section31sent3">I have substance, for I have borrowed what is all-sufficient to make me what I am from each of the elements out of which this world was framed, earth, water, air and fire.</s><s id="section31sent4">I have quality in so far as I am a man, and quantity as being of a certain size.</s><s id="section31sent5">I become relative when anyone is on my right hand or my left, I am active when I rub or shave</s><s id="section31sent6">anything, or passive when I am rubbed or shaved.</s><s id="section31sent7">I am in a particular state when I wear clothing or arms and in a particular position when I sit quietly or am lying down, and I am necessarily both in place and time since none of the above conditions can exist without these two.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">These points have been sufficiently discussed</s><s id="section32sent2">and may now be left.</s><s id="section32sent3">We must proceed to carry on the discussion to embrace what follows next.</s><s id="section32sent4">The ten words or oracles, in reality laws or statutes, were delivered by the Father of All when the nation, men and women alike, were assembled together.</s><s id="section32sent5">Did</s><s id="section32sent6">He do so by His own utterance in the form of a</s><s id="section32sent7">voice?</s><s id="section32sent8">Surely not: may no such thought ever enter our minds, for God is not as a man needing mouth and tongue and windpipe.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">I should suppose that</s><s id="section33sent2">God wrought on this occasion a miracle of a truly holy kind by bidding an invisible sound to be created in the air more marvellous than all instruments and fitted with perfect harmonies, not soulless, nor yet composed of body and soul like a living creature, but a rational soul full of clearness and distinctness, which giving shape and tension to the air and changing it to flaming fire, sounded forth like the breath through a trumpet an articulate voice so loud that it appeared to be equally audible to the farthest as well as the nearest.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">For it is the nature of men’s voices if</s><s id="section34sent2">carried to a great distance to grow faint so that persons afar off have but an indistinct impression which gradually fades away with each lengthening of the extension, since the organism which produces them also is subject to decay.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">But the new miraculous voice</s><s id="section35sent2">was set in action and kept in flame by the power of God which breathed upon it and spread it abroad on every side and made it more illuminating in its ending than in its beginning by creating in the souls of each and all another kind of hearing far superior to the hearing of the ears.</s><s id="section35sent3">For that is but a sluggish sense, inactive until aroused by the impact of the air, but the hearing of the mind possessed by God makes the first advance and goes out to meet the spoken words with the keenest rapidity.</s><s id="section35sent4">So much for the divine voice.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">But we may</s><s id="section36sent2">properly ask why, when all these many thousands were</s><s id="section36sent3">collected in one spot,</s><s id="section36sent4">He thought good in proclaiming</s><s id="section36sent5">His ten oracles to address each not as to several persons but as to one, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, and so too with the rest.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">One answer which must</s><s id="section37sent2">be given is that He wishes to teach the readers of the sacred scriptures a most excellent lesson, namely that each single person, when he is law-abiding and obedient to God, is equal in worth to a whole nation, even the most populous, or rather to all nations, and if we may go still farther, even to the whole world.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">And therefore elsewhere, when He praises a certain</s><s id="section38sent2">just man,</s><s id="section38sent3">He says, I am thy God,</s><s id="section38sent4">though He was also the God of the world.</s><s id="section38sent5">And thus we see that all the rank and file who are posted in the same line and give a like satisfaction to their commander, have an equal share of approbation and honour.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">A second reason is that a speaker who harangues</s><s id="section39sent2">a multitude in general does not necessarily talk to any one person, whereas if he addresses his commands or prohibitions as though to each individual separately, the practical instructions given in the course of his speech are at once held to apply to the whole body in common also.</s><s id="section39sent3">If the exhortations are received as a personal message, the hearer is more ready to obey, but if collectively with others, he is deaf to them, since he takes the multitude as a cover for disobedience.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">A third reason is that He wills that no king or</s><s id="section40sent2">despot swollen with arrogance and contempt should despise an insignificant private person but should study</s><s id="section40sent3">in the school of the divine laws and abate his supercilious airs, and through the reasonableness or rather the assured truth of their arguments unlearn his self-conceit</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">For if the Uncreated, the Incorruptible, the</s><s id="section41sent2">Eternal,</s><s id="section41sent3">Who needs nothing and is the maker of all, the Benefactor and King of kings and God of gods could not brook to despise even the humblest, but deigned to banquet him on holy oracles and statutes, as though he should be the sole guest, as though for him alone the feast was prepared to give good cheer to a soul instructed in the holy secrets and accepted for admission to the greatest mysteries, what right have I, the mortal, to bear myself proud-necked, puffed-up and loud-voiced, towards my fellows, who, though their fortunes be unequal, have equal rights of kinship because they can claim to be children of the one common mother of mankind, nature?</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">So</s><s id="section42sent2">then, though I be invested with the sovereignty of earth and sea, I will make myself affable and easy of access to the poorest, to the meanest, to the lonely who have none close at hand to help them, to orphans who have lost both parents, to wives on whom widowhood has fallen, to old men either childless from the first or bereaved by the early death of those whom they begot.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">For as I am a man, I shall not deem it</s><s id="section43sent2">right to adopt the lofty grandeur of the pompous stage, but make nature my home and not overstep her limits.</s><s id="section43sent3">I will inure my mind to have the feelings of a human being, not only because the lot both of the prosperous and the unfortunate may change to the reverse we know not when, but also because it is right that even if good fortune remains securely established, a man should not forget what he is.</s><s id="section43sent4">Such was the reason, as it seems to me, why he willed to word the series of his oracles in the singular form, and delivers them as though to one alone.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">It was natural that the place should be the</s><s id="section44sent2">scene of all that was wonderful, claps of thunder louder than the ears could hold, flashes of lightning of surpassing brightness, the sound of an invisible trumpet reaching to the greatest distance, the descent of a cloud which like a pillar stood with its foot planted on the earth, while the rest of its body extended to the height of the upper air, the rush of heaven-sent fire which shrouded all around in dense smoke.</s><s id="section44sent3">For when the power of God arrives, needs must be that no part of the world should remain inactive, but all move together to do Him service.</s><s id="section44sent4">Near by stood the people.</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section45"><s id="section45sent1">They had kept pure from</s><s id="section45sent2">intercourse with women and abstained from all pleasures save those which are necessary for the sustenance of life.</s><s id="section45sent3">They had cleansed themselves with ablutions and lustrations for three days past, and moreover had washed their clothes.</s><s id="section45sent4">So in the whitest of raiment they stood on tiptoe with ears pricked up in obedience to the warning of Moses to prepare themselves for a congregation which he knew would be held from the oracular advice he received when he was summoned up by himself.</s></p></div>
<div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section46"><s id="section46sent1">Then from</s><s id="section46sent2">the midst of the fire that streamed from heaven there sounded forth to their utter amazement a voice, for the flame became articulate speech in the language familiar to the audience, and so clearly and distinctly were the words formed by it that they seemed to see rather than hear them.</s></p></div>
<div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section47"><s id="section47sent1">What I say is vouched for</s><s id="section47sent2">by the law in which it is written, “All the people saw the voice,”</s><s id="section47sent3">a phrase fraught with much meaning,</s><s id="section47sent4">for it is the case that the voice of men is audible, but the voice of God truly visible.</s><s id="section47sent5">Why so?</s><s id="section47sent6">Because whatever God says is not words but deeds, which are judged by the eyes rather than the ears.</s></p></div>
