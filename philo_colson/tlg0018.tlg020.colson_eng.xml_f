On Abraham
That is, the Life of the Wise Man Made Perfect Through Teaching, or the First Book on Unwritten Laws
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">The first of the five books in which the holy</s><s id="section1sent2">laws are written bears the name and inscription of Genesis, from the genesis or creation of the world, an account of which it contains at its beginning.</s><s id="section1sent3">It has received this title in spite of its embracing numberless other matters; for it tells of peace and war, of fruitfulness and barrenness, of dearth and plenty; how fire and water wrought great destruction of what is on earth;</s><s id="section1sent4">how on the other hand plants and animals were born and throve through the kindly tempering of the air and the yearly seasons, and so too men, some of whom lived a life of virtue, others of vice.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">But since some of these things are</s><s id="section2sent2">parts of the world, and others events which befall it.</s><s id="section2sent3">and the world is the complete consummation which contains them all, he dedicated the whole book to it.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">The story of the order in which the world was made has been set forth in detail by us as well as was possible in the preceding treatise</s><s id="section3sent2">; but, since</s><s id="section3sent3">it is necessary to carry out our examination of the law in regular sequence, let us postpone consideration of particular laws, which are, so to speak, copies, and examine first those which are more general and</s><s id="section3sent4">may be called the originals of those copies.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">These</s><s id="section4sent2">are such men as lived good and blameless lives, whose virtues stand permanently recorded in the most holy scriptures, not merely to sound their praises but for the instruction of the reader and as an inducement to him to aspire to the same;</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">for in</s><s id="section5sent2">these men we have laws endowed with life and reason,</s><s id="section5sent3">and Moses extolled them for two reasons.</s><s id="section5sent4">First he wished to shew that the enacted ordinances are not inconsistent with nature; and secondly that those who wish to live in accordance with the laws as they stand have no difficult task, seeing that the first generations before any at all of the particular statutes was set in writing followed the unwritten law with perfect ease, so that one might properly say that the enacted laws are nothing else than memorials of the life of the ancients, preserving to a later generation their actual words and deeds.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">For they were not scholars or pupils of others, nor</s><s id="section6sent2">did they learn under teachers what was right to say or do: they listened to no voice or instruction but their own: they gladly accepted conformity with nature, holding that nature itself was, as indeed it is, the most venerable of statutes, and thus their whole life was one of happy obedience to law.</s><s id="section6sent3">They committed no guilty action of their own free will or purpose, and where chance led them wrong they besought God’s mercy and propitiated Him with prayers and supplications, and thus secured a perfect life guided aright in both fields, both in their premeditated actions and in such as were not of freely-willed purpose.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">Since, then, the first step towards the possession</s><s id="section7sent2">of blessings is hope, and hope like a high road is</s><s id="section7sent3">constructed and opened up by the virtue-loving soul in its eagerness to gain true excellence, Moses called the first lover of hope “Man,” thus bestowing on him as a special favour the name which is common to the race (for the Chaldean</s><s id="section7sent4">name for Man is Enos),</s><s id="section7sent5">on the grounds that he alone is a true man who expects good things and rests firmly on comfortable hopes.</s><s id="section7sent6">This plainly shows that he regards a despondent person as no man but a beast in human shape, since he has been robbed of the nearest and dearest possession of the human soul, namely hope.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">And, therefore, in his wish to give the highest praise</s><s id="section8sent2">to the hoper, after first stating that he set his hope on the Father and Maker of all, he adds, “this is the book of the coming into being of men,” though fathers and grandfathers had already come into being.</s><s id="section8sent3">But he held that they were the founders of the mixed race, but Enos of that from which all impurity had been strained, in fact of the race which is truly reasonable.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">For just as we give the title of</s><s id="section9sent2">“the poet” to Homer in virtue of his pre-eminence, though there are multitudes of poets besides him, and “the black”</s><s id="section9sent3">to the material with which we write, though everything is black which is not white, and “the Archon”</s><s id="section9sent4">at Athens to the chief of the nine archons, the Archon Eponymos, from whose year of office dates are calculated, so too Moses gave the name of man in pre-eminence to him who cherished hope and left unnoticed the many others as un</s><s id="section9sent5">worthy to receive the same title.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">He did</s><s id="section10sent2">well, too, in speaking of the book of the coming into being of the true man.</s><s id="section10sent3">The word was appropriate because the hoper deserves a memorial written not on pieces of paper which moths shall destroy but in the undying book of nature where good actions are registered.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">Further, if we reckon the</s><s id="section11sent2">generations from the first, the earth-born man, we shall find that he, who is called by the Chaldeans Enos and in our tongue Man, is fourth.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Now the</s><s id="section12sent2">number four has been held in high honour by the other philosophers who devoted themselves to the study of immaterial and conceptual realities, and especially by the all-wise Moses who when glorifying that number speaks of it as “holy and for praise,”</s><s id="section12sent3">and why he so called it has been shewn in the former treatise.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Holy, too, and praiseworthy is the hopeful</s><s id="section13sent2">man, just as on the contrary the despondent is unholy and blameworthy, since in all things he takes fear for his evil counsellor; for no two things are more at enmity with each other, men say, than fear and hope, and surely that is natural, for each is an expectation, hope of good, fear on the other hand of evil, and their natures are irreconcilable and incapable of agreement.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">No more need be said about</s><s id="section14sent2">the subject of hope, set by nature as a door-keeper at the portals of the royal virtues within, to which access cannot be gained unless we have first paid our respects to her.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">Great indeed are the efforts</s><s id="section15sent2">expended both by lawgivers and by laws in every nation in filling the souls of free men with comfortable hopes; but he who gains this virtue of hopefulness without being led to it by exhortation or command has been educated into it by a law which nature has laid down, a law unwritten yet intuitively learnt.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">The second place after hope is given to repentance</s><s id="section16sent2">for sins and to improvement, and, therefore, Moses mentions next in order him who changed from the worse life to the better, called by the Hebrews Enoch but in our language “recipient of grace.”</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">We are told of him that he proved “to be pleasing to God and was not found because God transferred him,</s><s id="section17sent2">“for</s><s id="section17sent3">transference implies turning and changing, and the change is to the better because it is brought about by the forethought of God.</s><s id="section17sent4">For all that is done with God’s help is excellent and truly profitable, as also all that has not His directing care is unprofitable.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">And the expression used of the transferred</s><s id="section18sent2">person, that he was not found, is well said, either because the old reprehensible life is blotted out and disappears and is no more found, as though it had never been at all, or because he who is thus transferred and takes his place in the better class is naturally hard to find.</s><s id="section18sent3">For evil is widely spread and therefore known to many, while virtue is rare, so that even the few cannot comprehend it.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Besides,</s><s id="section19sent2">the worthless man whose life is one long restlessness haunts market-places, theatres, law-courts, council-halls, assemblies, and every group and gathering of men; his tongue he lets loose for unmeasured, endless, indiscriminate talk, bringing chaos and confusion into everything, mixing true with false, fit with unfit, public with private, holy with profane, sensible with absurd, because he has not been trained to that silence which in season is most excellent.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">His ears</s><s id="section20sent2">he keeps alert in meddlesome curiosity, ever eager to learn his neighbour’s affairs, whether good or bad, and ready with envy for the former and joy at the latter; for the worthless man is a creature naturally malicious, a hater of good and lover of evil.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">The man of worth on the other hand, having acquired</s><s id="section21sent2">a desire for a quiet life, withdraws from the public and loves solitude, and his choice is to be unnoticed by the many, not because he is misanthropical, for he is eminently a philanthropist, but because he has rejected vice which is welcomed by the multitude who rejoice at what calls for mourning and grieve where it is well to be glad.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">And therefore he mostly</s><s id="section22sent2">secludes himself at home and scarcely ever crosses his threshold, or else because of the frequency of visitors he leaves the town and spends his days in some lonely farm, finding pleasanter society in those noblest of the whole human race whose bodies time has turned into dust but the flame of their virtues is kept alive by the written records which have survived them in poetry or in prose and serve</s><s id="section22sent3">to promote the growth of goodness in the soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">That</s><s id="section23sent2">was why he said that the “transferred” was not found, being hard to find and hard to seek.</s><s id="section23sent3">So he passes across from ignorance to instruction, from folly to sound sense, from cowardice to courage, from impiety to piety, and again from voluptuousness to self-control, from vaingloriousness to simplicity.</s><s id="section23sent4">And what wealth is equal in worth to these, or what possession of royalty or dominion more profitable?</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">For in very truth the wealth which is not blind</s><s id="section24sent2">but keen of sight is abundance of virtues, which consequently we must needs hold to be, in contrast to the bastard governments falsely so-called, genuine and equitable sovereignty ruling in justice over all.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">But we must not forget that repentance</s><s id="section25sent2">holds the second place to perfection, just as a change from sickness to health is second to a body free from disease; so, then, unbroken perfection of virtues stands nearest to divine power, but improvement in the course of time is the peculiar treasure of a soul gifted by nature, which does not stay in childish thoughts but by such as are more robust and truly manly seeks to gain a condition of serenity and pursues the vision of the excellent.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">Naturally, therefore, next to the repentant he</s><s id="section26sent2">sets the lover of virtue and beloved by God, who in the Hebrew language is called Noah but in ours “rest” or “just,” both very suitable titles for the Sage.</s><s id="section26sent3">“Just” is obviously so, for nothing is better than justice, the chief among the virtues, who like the fairest maiden of the dance holds the highest place.</s><s id="section26sent4">But “rest” is appropriate also, since its opposite, unnatural movement,</s><s id="section26sent5">proves to be the cause</s><s id="section26sent6">of turmoil and confusion and factions and wars.</s><s id="section26sent7">Such movement is sought by the worthless, while a life which is calm, serene, tranquil and peaceful to boot is the object of those who have valued nobility of conduct.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">He shews consistency, too, when he</s><s id="section27sent2">gives to the seventh day, which the Hebrews call sabbath, the name of rest; not, as some think, because the multitude abstained after six days from their usual tasks, but because in truth the number seven, both in the world and in ourselves, is always free from factions and war and quarrelling and is of all numbers the most peaceful.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">This statement is attested by</s><s id="section28sent2">the faculties within us, for six</s><s id="section28sent3">of them wage ceaseless and continuous war on land and sea, namely the five senses and speech, the former in their craving for the objects of sense, deprivation of which is painful to them, speech because with unbridled mouth it perpetually gives utterance where silence is due.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">But the seventh faculty is that of the</s><s id="section29sent2">dominant mind, which, after triumphing over the six and returning victorious through its superior strength, welcomes solitude and rejoices in its own society, feeling that it needs no other and is completely sufficient for itself, and then released from the cares and concerns of mortal kind gladly accepts a life of calmness and serenity.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">So highly does Moses extol the lover of virtue</s><s id="section30sent2">that when he gives his genealogy he does not, as he usually does in other cases, make a list of his grandfathers, great-grandfathers and ancestors in the male and female line, but of certain virtues, and this is</s><s id="section30sent3">little less than a direct assertion that a sage has no house or kinsfolk or country save virtues and virtuous actions; “for these,” he says, “are the generations of Noah.</s><s id="section30sent4">Noah, a man just and perfect in his generation, was well-pleasing to God.”</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">But we must not</s><s id="section31sent2">fail to note that in this passage he gives the name of man not according to the common form of speech, to the mortal animal endowed with reason, but to the man who is man pre-eminently, who verifies the name by having expelled from the soul the untamed and frantic passions and the truly beast-like vices.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">Here</s><s id="section32sent2">is a proof.</s><s id="section32sent3">After “man” he adds “just,” implying by the combination</s><s id="section32sent4">that the unjust is no man, or more properly speaking a beast in human form, and that the follower after righteousness alone is man.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">He says, too, that Noah became “perfect,” thereby</s><s id="section33sent2">shewing that he acquired not one virtue but all, and having acquired them continued to exercise each as opportunities allowed.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">And as he crowns him</s><s id="section34sent2">as victor in the contest, he gives him further distinction by a proclamation couched in words of splendid praise, “he was well-pleasing to God.”</s><s id="section34sent3">What better thing than this has nature to give?</s><s id="section34sent4">What clearer proof can there be of nobility of life?</s><s id="section34sent5">For, if those who have been ill-pleasing to God are ill-fated, happy most surely are those whose lot it is to be well-pleasing to God.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">But Moses makes</s><s id="section35sent2">a good point when, after praising him as possessed of all these virtues, he adds that he was perfect in his generation, thus shewing he was not good absolutely but in comparison with the men of that time.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">For</s><s id="section36sent2">we shall shortly find him mentioning other sages whose virtue was unchallenged, who are not contrasted with the bad, who are adjudged worthy of approval and precedence, not because they were better than their contemporaries but because they possessed a happily-gifted nature and kept it un-perverted, who did not have to shun evil courses or indeed come into contact with them at all, but attained pre-eminence in practising that excellence of words and deeds with which they adorned their lives.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">The highest admiration, then, is due to those</s><s id="section37sent2">in whom the ruling impulses were of free and noble birth, who accepted the excellent and just for their own selves and not in imitation of or in opposition to others.</s><s id="section37sent3">But admiration is also due to him who stood apart from his own generation and conformed himself to none of the aims and aspirations of the many.</s><s id="section37sent4">He will win the second prize, though the first will be awarded by nature to those others.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">Yet great also is</s><s id="section38sent2">the second prize in itself, for how could anything fail to be great and worthy of our efforts which God offers and gives?</s><s id="section38sent3">And the clearest proof of this is the exceeding magnitude of the bounties which Noah obtained.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">That time bore its harvest of iniquities, and</s><s id="section39sent2">every country and nation and city and household and every private individual was filled with evil practices; one and all, as though in a race, engaged in rivalry pre-willed and premeditated for the first places in sinfulness, and put all possible zeal into the contention, each one pressing on to exceed his neighbour in magnitude of vice and leaving nothing undone which could lead to a guilty and accursed life.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">Naturally this roused the wrath of God, to think that</s><s id="section40sent2">man, who seemed the best of all living creatures,</s><s id="section40sent3">who had been judged worthy of kinship with Him because he shared the gift of reason, had, instead of practising virtue as he should, shewn zeal for vice and for every particular form of it.</s><s id="section40sent4">Accordingly</s><s id="section40sent5">He appointed the penalty which fitted their wickedness.</s><s id="section40sent6">He determined to destroy all those who were then alive by a deluge, not only those who dwelt in the plains and lower lands, but also the inhabitants of the highest mountains.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">For the great deep</s><s id="section41sent2">rose on</s><s id="section41sent3">high as it had never risen before, and gathering its force rushed through its outlets into the seas of our parts, and the rising tides of these flooded the islands and continents, while in quick succession the streams from the perennial fountains and from the rivers spring-fed or winter-torrents pressed on to join each other and mounted upwards to a vast height.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">Nor</s><s id="section42sent2">was the air still, for a deep unbroken cloud covered the heaven, and there were monstrous blasts of wind and crashings of thunder and flashings of lightning and downfall of thunderbolts, while the rainstorms dashed down ceaselessly, so that one might think that the different parts of the universe were hurrying to be resolved into the single element of water, until, as in one form it rushed down from above and in another rose up from below, the streams were lifted on high, and thus not only the plains and lowlands were submerged and lost to sight, but even the peaks of the highest mountains.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">For all parts of the</s><s id="section43sent2">earth sank below the water, so that it was entirely carried away as though by violence, and the world seemed mutilated by the loss of a great section, its completeness and perfection destroyed and defaced,</s><s id="section43sent3">a thing too terrible for words or even for thoughts.</s><s id="section43sent4">Indeed even the air, except a small portion belonging to the moon, had been completely made away with, vanquished by the rush and violence of the water which perforce occupied its place.</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">Then</s><s id="section44sent2">indeed at once all crops and trees perished, for excessive quantity of water is as destructive as the lack of it, and the numberless herds of animals died, tame and wild alike; for it was to be expected that if the highest kind, the human, was annihilated none of the inferior kinds would be left, since they were made for man’s needs, as slaves in a sense meant to obey their masters’ orders.</s></p></div>
<div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section45"><s id="section45sent1">When all these</s><s id="section45sent2">evils, so many and so vast, had burst upon the world in the downpour which that occasion brought, and the unnatural convulsion had shaken all its parts save the heavenly as with a grievous and deadly plague, one house alone, that of the man called just and dear to God, was preserved.</s><s id="section45sent3">Thus he received two gifts of the highest kind—one that, as I have said, he did not perish with the rest, the other that he should be in his turn the founder of a new race of men.</s><s id="section45sent4">For God deemed him worthy to be both the last and the first of our kind—last of those who lived before the flood and first of those who lived after it.</s></p></div>
<div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section46"><s id="section46sent1">Such was he who was best of his contemporaries,</s><s id="section46sent2">and such were the prizes awarded to him, the nature of which is made clear in holy writ.</s><s id="section46sent3">Now the three mentioned above, whether we think of them as men or types of soul, form a series of regular gradation: the perfect man is complete from the first; the transferred stands half-way, since he devoted the earlier part of his life to vice but the latter to</s><s id="section46sent4">virtue to which he passed over and migrated; the hoper, as his very name shews, is defective inasmuch as though he always desired the excellent he has not yet been able to attain to it, but resembles sailors eager to put into port, who yet remain at sea unable to reach their haven.</s></p></div>
<div n="48" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section47"><s id="section47sent1">So now we have explained the first trinity of</s><s id="section47sent2">those who yearn for virtue; but greater is the second trinity of which we have now to speak.</s><s id="section47sent3">The first we may compare to the studies of children, but the latter to the exercises of athletes who are preparing for games which are really sacred,</s><s id="section47sent4">men who despise bodily training but foster robustness of soul in their desire for victory over their antagonists, the passions.</s></p></div>
