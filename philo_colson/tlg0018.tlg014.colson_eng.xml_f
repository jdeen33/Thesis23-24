On the Migration of Abraham
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">“And the Lord said unto Abraham, Depart out</s><s id="section1sent2">of thy land, and out of thy kindred, and out of thy father’s house, into the land which I shall shew thee; and I will make thee a great nation and will bless thee and will make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed.</s><s id="section1sent3">And I will bless them that bless thee, and them that curse thee I will curse, and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed” (Gen. xii. 1–3).</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">God begins the carrying out of His will</s><s id="section2sent2">to cleanse man’s soul by giving it a starting-point for full salvation in its removal out of three localities, namely, body, sense-perception, and speech.</s><s id="section2sent3">“Land”
or “country” is a symbol of body, “kindred” of sense-perception, “father’s house” of speech.</s><s id="section2sent4">How so?</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">Because the body took its substance out of</s><s id="section3sent2">earth (or land) and is again resolved into earth.</s><s id="section3sent3">Moses is a witness to this, when he says, “Earth thou art and into earth shalt thou return” (Gen. iii. 19); indeed he also says that the body was clay formed into human shape by God’s moulding hand, and what suffers solution must needs be resolved into the elements which were united to form it.</s><s id="section3sent4">Sense-perception, again, is of one kin and family with understanding, the irrational with the rational, for both these are parts of one soul.</s><s id="section3sent5">And speech is our
“father’s house,” “father’s” because Mind is our</s><s id="section3sent6">father, sowing in each of the parts of the body the faculties that issue from itself, and assigning to them their workings, being in control and charge of them all; house—because mind has speech for its house</s><s id="section3sent7">or living-room, secluded from the rest of the homestead.</s><s id="section3sent8">It is Mind’s living-place, just as the hearth-side is man’s.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">It is there that Mind displays in</s><s id="section4sent2">orderly form itself and all the conceptions to which it gives birth, treating it as a man treats a house.</s><s id="section4sent3">And marvel not at Moses having given to speech the title of Mind’s house in man; for indeed he says that God, the Mind of the universe, has for His house His own Word.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">It was the vision of</s><s id="section5sent2">this Word that the Self-trainer received when he emphatically declares “This is assuredly not the House of God”</s><s id="section5sent3">(Gen. xxviii. 17), as much as to say
“The House of God is not this that is all round me, consisting of things at which we can point or that fall under sense-perception generally, no, not such is God’s House, but invisible, withdrawn from sight, and apprehended only by soul as soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">Who, then, can</s><s id="section6sent2">that House be, save the Word who is antecedent to all that has come into existence?</s><s id="section6sent3">the Word, which the Helmsman of the Universe grasps as a rudder to guide all things on their course?</s><s id="section6sent4">Even as, when</s><s id="section6sent5">He was fashioning the world, He employed it as His instrument, that the fabric of His handiwork might be without reproach.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">We have now shewn how Moses uses “earth”</s><s id="section7sent2">to represent the body, “kindred” to represent sense-perception, “thy father’s house” to represent speech.</s><s id="section7sent3">The words “Depart out of these” are not equivalent to “Sever thyself from them absolutely,”
since to issue such a command as that would be to prescribe death.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">No, the words import “Make thyself a stranger to them in judgement and purpose; let none of them cling to thee; rise superior to them all; they are thy subjects, never treat them as</s><s id="section8sent2">sovereign lords; thou art a king, school thyself once and for all to rule, not to be ruled; evermore be coming to know thyself, as Moses teaches thee in many places, saying “Give heed to thyself” (Ex. xxiv. 12), for in this way shalt thou perceive those to whom it befits thee to shew obedience and those to whom it befits thee to give commands.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">Depart,</s><s id="section9sent2">therefore, out of the earthly matter that encompasses thee: escape, man, from the foul prison-house, thy body, with all thy might and main, and from the pleasures and lusts that act as its jailers; every terror that can vex and hurt them, leave none of them unused; menace the enemy with them all united and combined.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">Depart also out of sense-perception</s><s id="section10sent2">thy kin.</s><s id="section10sent3">For at present thou hast made a loan of thyself to each sense, and art become the property of others, a portion of the goods of those who have borrowed thee, and hast thrown away the good thing that was thine own.</s><s id="section10sent4">Yes, thou knowest, even though all men should hold their peace, how eyes draw thee, and ears, and the whole crowd of thine other kinsfolk, towards what they themselves love.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">But if thou desire to recover the self that thou</s><s id="section11sent2">hast lent and to have thine own possessions about</s><s id="section11sent3">thee, letting no portion of them be alienated and fall into other hands, thou shalt claim instead a happy life, enjoying in perpetuity the benefit and pleasure derived from good things not foreign to thee but thine own.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Again, quit speech also, “thy</s><s id="section12sent2">father’s house,” as Moses calls it, for fear thou shouldst be beguiled by beauties of mere phrasing, and be cut off from the real beauty, which lies in the matter expressed.</s><s id="section12sent3">Monstrous it is that shadow should be preferred to substance or a copy to originals.</s><s id="section12sent4">And verbal expression is like a shadow or copy, while the essential bearing of the matters conveyed by words resembles substance and originals; and it behoves the man, whose aim it is to be rather than to seem, to dissociate himself from the former and hold fast to the latter.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">So we find</s><s id="section13sent2">that when the Mind begins to know itself and to hold converse with the things of mind, it will thrust away from it that part of the soul which inclines to the province of sense-perception, the inclining which among the Hebrews is entitled “Lot.”</s><s id="section13sent3">Hence the wise man is represented as saying outright, “Separate thyself from me” (Gen. xiii. 9).</s><s id="section13sent4">For it is impossible for one who is possessed by love for all that is incorporeal and incorruptible to dwell together with one who leans towards the objects of sense-perception doomed to die.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Right well, then, did the Sacred</s><s id="section14sent2">Guide inscribe one entire sacred book of the Lawgiving “Exagoge” or “Leading out,” for the name thus found was appropriate to the oracles contained in it.</s><s id="section14sent3">For being well qualified to train men and fully furnished for the admonition and correction of those who were capable of admonition and correction, he contemplates the task of taking out all the population</s><s id="section14sent4">of the soul right away from Egypt, the body, and away from its inhabitants; deeming it a most sore and heavy burden that an understanding endowed with vision should be under the pressure of the pleasures of the flesh, and should submit to such injunctions as its merciless cravings may lay upon it.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">These, indeed, groaned over and greatly bewailed</s><s id="section15sent2">their bodily well-being, and the lavish abundance of things outside the body,</s><s id="section15sent3">which was theirs, for we read that “the children of Israel groaned by reason of their works</s><s id="section15sent4">” (Ex. ii. 23).</s><s id="section15sent5">When they do this, the gracious God instructs</s><s id="section15sent6">His prophet regarding their coming out, and His prophet delivers them.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">But some make a truce with the body and maintain</s><s id="section16sent2">it till their death, and are buried in it as in a coffin or shell or whatever else you like to call it.</s><s id="section16sent3">All the body-loving and passion-loving portions of these are laid in the grave and consigned to oblivion.</s><s id="section16sent4">But if anywhere by the side of these there grows up a virtue-loving tendency, it is saved from extinction by memories, which are a means of keeping alive the flame of noble qualities.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">So the Holy</s><s id="section17sent2">Word, deeming it unfitting that pure things should have impure things associated with them, provides for the safe-keeping of Joseph’s bones, by which I mean the only relics of such a soul as were left behind untouched by corruption and worthy of perpetual memory (Gen. 1.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">25).</s><s id="section18sent2">Those of the</s><s id="section18sent3">latter kind were these; Joseph’s confidence that
“God will visit” the race that has vision (Gen. 1. 24),</s><s id="section18sent4">and will not utterly hand it over to Ignorance, that blind task-mistress; his discernment between the mortal and the incorruptible portions of the soul and his leaving behind to Egypt those which had to do with bodily pleasures and other forms of unrestrained passion, while concerning the incorruptible parts he made an agreement, that they should accompany those who went up to the cities of virtue, and should be conveyed thither, and had the agreement secured by an oath.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">What, then, are the un-corrupted</s><s id="section19sent2">parts?</s><s id="section19sent3">His having nothing to do with Pleasure when she says, “Let us lie together” (Gen. xxxix.</s><s id="section19sent4">7) and enjoy the good things of mankind: the shrewdness coupled with the resoluteness which enabled him to recognize the products of empty fancies which many accounted to be good, and to distinguish them as mere dreams from those which are really so; and to confess that the true and certain interpretations of things are given under God’s guidance (Gen. xl. 8), while the doubtful imaginations that have no certainty follow the rule and line of the erring and deluded life of men who have not undergone purification, a life that finds its joy in the delights provided by bakers and cooks</s><s id="section19sent5">and butlers.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Other traits of incorruption were these: he was proclaimed</s><s id="section20sent2">not the subject, but the ruler of all Egypt, the domain of the body (Gen. xli. 41): he was proud to own himself a member of the Hebrew race (Gen. xl. 15), whose wont it is, as the name “Hebrew”
or “Migrant” indicates, to quit the objects of sense-perception and go after those of Mind: he gloried in the fact that “here he had done nothing” (ibid.), for to have performed no single act such as the worthless people there admired, but to have utterly</s><s id="section20sent3">hated and eschewed them all, was conduct that called</s><s id="section20sent4">for no slight praise:</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">he derided lusts and all passions and their gross excesses (Gen. xxxix.</s><s id="section21sent2">14, 17):</s><s id="section21sent3">he feared God (Gen. xlii. 18) even though he was not yet ready to love Him: when in Egypt he claimed as his own the life that is real life,</s><s id="section21sent4">() a claim which caused Israel to marvel in just amazement, and to cry, “It is a great matter in my eyes if my son Joseph still lives”(Gen. xlv. 28), and has not shared the death of vain opinions, and of the body the corpse he carries with him:</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">he confesses that he is God’s</s><s id="section22sent2">(Gen. 1. 19),</s><s id="section22sent3">not the property of any created being: when making himself known to his brethren he thrust perforce from his presence, shaken and tottering, all those frames of mind that make the body their delight and think that their own doctrines afford them a firm standing (Gen. xlv. 1 f.): he declared that he had not received his commission at the hands of men, but had been appointed by God (Gen. xlv. 7 f.) to be duly constituted controller of the body and of things outside the body.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">And these are</s><s id="section23sent2">but a few of the traits indicative of the better and holier standing, which utterly refuse to dwell in Egypt the bodily tenement, are never buried in a coffin at all, but, having passed out of all that is mortal, follow the guiding steps of Moses, the Lawgiving Word.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">For Moses is the nursing-father who</s><s id="section24sent2">rears with fostering care noble deeds, words, designs, which, albeit often mingled with their opposites owing to the chaos and confusion which besets mortality, he none the less comes forward and separates from</s><s id="section24sent3">the rest, that the germs and shoots of moral excellence may not permanently be obliterated and lost.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">Moses also urges the Israelites to quit right stoutly</s><s id="section25sent2">her who bears the name of mother of every monstrous thing, with no slow or lingering steps, but with exceeding speed; for he bids them with haste to sacrifice the Passover (Ex. xii. 11), which means “a passing over,” to the intent that the Mind with resolute purpose and unfailing eagerness may carry out both its passing away from the passions without turning back, and its thanksgiving to God its Saviour, Who brought it forth into liberty when it looked not for it.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">And what is there to wonder at</s><s id="section26sent2">in his urging the mind, that had been brought under the control of irrational passion, not to give in, nor to be swept down by the violence of that passion’s current, but to resist with all its might, and, should it fail, even to run away?</s><s id="section26sent3">For flight remains as an alternative way of reaching safety for those who are not able to repel the danger.</s><s id="section26sent4">See how Moses deals with one who was by nature a sturdy fighter and had never become the slave of passions, but was always engaged in the conflict with each one of them?</s><s id="section26sent5">Even him he forbids to keep up his wrestlings to the end, lest one day, by perpetually meeting them, he should contract from them a pernicious taint; for many before now have proved imitators of an opponent’s vice, as others on the other hand have imitated his virtue.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">For this reason a Divine intimation was</s><s id="section27sent2">vouchsafed to him to this effect: “Turn back to the land of thy father and thy kindred, and I will be with thee” (Gen. xxxi. 3); as much as to say “Thou</s><s id="section27sent3">hast proved thyself a perfect athlete, and been awarded prizes and crowns with Virtue presiding and holding forth to thee the meed of victory: but now it is time for thee to have done with strife, lest thou be ever toiling, and have no power to reap the fruits of thy toil.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">This thou wilt never find while thou remainest</s><s id="section28sent2">where thou art, dwelling still with the objects of sense-perception, and spending thy days surrounded by bodily existence in its varied aspects, whose head and chief is Laban, bearing a name meaning variety of character.</s><s id="section28sent3">Nay, thou must change thine abode and betake thee to thy father’s land, the land of the Word that is holy and in some sense father of those who submit to training: and that land is Wisdom, abode most choice of virtue-loving souls.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">In this</s><s id="section29sent2">country there awaiteth thee the nature which is its own pupil, its own teacher, that needs not to be fed on milk as children are fed,</s><s id="section29sent3">that has been stayed by a Divine oracle from going down into Egypt (Gen. xxvi.</s><s id="section29sent4">2) and from meeting with the ensnaring pleasures of the flesh.</s><s id="section29sent5">That nature is entitled Isaac.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">When</s><s id="section30sent2">thou hast entered upon his inheritance, thou canst not but lay aside thy toil; for the perpetual abundance of good things ever ready to the hand gives freedom from toil.</s><s id="section30sent3">And the fountain from which the good things are poured forth is the companionship of the bountiful God.</s><s id="section30sent4">He shews this to be so when to set His seal upon the flow of His kindnesses, He says “I will be with thee.”</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">What</s><s id="section31sent2">fair thing, then, could fail when there was present God the Perfecter, with gifts of grace, His virgin daughters, whom the Father that begat them rears up uncorrupted and undefiled?</s><s id="section31sent3">Then are all forms of studying, toiling, practising at rest; and without</s><s id="section31sent4">interference of art by contrivance of Nature there come forth all things in one outburst charged with benefit for all.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">And the harvest of spontaneous</s><s id="section32sent2">good things is called “Release,”</s><s id="section32sent3">inasmuch as the Mind is released from the working out of its own projects, and is, we may say, emancipated from self-chosen tasks, by reason of the abundance of the rain and ceaseless shower of blessings.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">And these</s><s id="section33sent2">are of a most marvellous nature and passing fair.</s><s id="section33sent3">For the offspring of the soul’s own travail are for the most part poor abortions, things untimely born; but those which God waters with the snows of heaven come to the birth perfect, complete and peerless.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">I feel no shame in recording my own</s><s id="section34sent2">experience, a thing I know from its having happened to me a thousand times.</s><s id="section34sent3">On some occasions, after making up my mind to follow the usual course of writing on philosophical tenets, and knowing definitely the substance of what I was to set down, I have found my understanding incapable of giving birth to a single idea, and have given it up without accomplishing anything, reviling my understanding for its self-conceit, and filled with amazement at the might of Him that is to Whom is due the opening and closing of the soul-wombs.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">On other</s><s id="section35sent2">occasions, I have approached my work empty and suddenly become full, the ideas falling in a shower from above and being sown invisibly, so that under the influence of the Divine possession I have been filled with corybantic frenzy and been unconscious of anything, place, persons present, myself, words spoken, lines written.</s><s id="section35sent3">For I obtained language, ideas, an enjoyment of light, keenest vision, pellucid distinctness</s><s id="section35sent4">of objects, such as might be received through the eyes as the result of clearest shewing.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">Now the thing shewn is the thing worthy to</s><s id="section36sent2">be seen, contemplated, loved, the perfect good, whose nature it is to change all that is bitter in the soul and make it sweet, fairest seasoning of all spices, turning into salutary nourishment even foods that do not nourish.</s><s id="section36sent3">So we read “The Lord shewed him a tree, and he cast it into the water” (Ex. xv. 25), that is into the flabby, flaccid mind teeming with bitterness, that its savagery might be sweetened away.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">This</s><s id="section37sent2">tree offers not nourishment only but immortality also, for we are told that the Tree of Life has been planted in the midst of the Garden (Gen. ii. 9), even Goodness with the particular virtues and the doings which accord with them to be its bodyguard.</s><s id="section37sent3">For it is Virtue that has obtained as its own the central and most honourable place in the soul.</s></p></div>

<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">For the current coin of learning and teaching</s><s id="section39sent2">from which Jacob took his title is reminted into the seeing Israel.</s><s id="section39sent3">Hereby comes to pass even the seeing of the Divine light, identical with knowledge, which opens wide the soul’s eye, and leads it to apprehensions distinct and brilliant beyond those</s><s id="section39sent4">gained by the ears.</s><s id="section39sent5">For as the application of the principles of music</s><s id="section39sent6">is apprehended through the science of music, and the practice of each science through that science, even so only through wisdom comes discernment of what is wise.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">But wisdom is</s><s id="section40sent2">not only, after the manner of light, an instrument of sight, but is able to see its own self besides.</s><s id="section40sent3">Wisdom is God’s archetypal luminary and the sun is a copy and image of it.</s><s id="section40sent4">But he that shews each
several object is God, who alone is possessed of perfect knowledge.</s><s id="section40sent5">For men are only said to have knowledge because they seem to know; whereas God is so called because</s><s id="section40sent6">He is the possessor of knowledge though the phrase does not adequately express this nature; for all things whatever that can be said regarding Him that is fall far short of the reality of His powers.</s></p></div>
