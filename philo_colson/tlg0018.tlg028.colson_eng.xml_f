On the Contemplative Life or Suppliants
(the fourth part concerning the virtues)

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">I have discussed the Essenes, who persistently</s><s id="section1sent2">pursued the active life and excelled in all or, to put it more moderately, in most of its departments.</s><s id="section1sent3">I will now proceed at once in accordance with the sequence required by the subject to say what is needed about those who embraced the life of contemplation.</s><s id="section1sent4">In doing so I will not add anything of my own procuring to improve upon the facts as is constantly done by poets and historians through lack of excellence in the lives and practices which they record, but shall adhere absolutely to the actual truth.</s><s id="section1sent5">Though I know that in this case it is such as to unnerve the greatest master of oratory, still we must persevere and not decline the conflict, for the magnitude of virtue shown by these men must not be allowed to tie the tongues of those who hold that nothing excellent should be passed over in silence.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">The vocation</s><s id="section2sent2">of these philosophers</s><s id="section2sent3">is at once made clear from their title of</s><s id="section2sent4">Therapeutae and Therapeutrides, a name derived</s><s id="section2sent5">from θεραπεύω, either in the sense of “cure”
because they profess an art of healing better than that current in the cities which cures only the bodies, while theirs treats also souls oppressed with grievous and well-nigh incurable diseases, inflicted by pleasures and desires and griefs and fears, by acts of covetousness,
folly and injustice and the countless host of the other passions and vices: or else in the sense of
“worship,” because nature and the sacred laws have schooled them to worship the Self-existent who is better than the good, purer than the One and more primordial than the Monad.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">Who among those who</s><s id="section3sent2">profess piety deserve to be compared with these?</s><s id="section3sent3">Can we compare those who revere the elements, earth, water, air, fire, which have received different names from different peoples who call fire Hephaestus because it is kindled (ἐξάπτω), air Hera because it is lifted up (αἴρω) and exalted on high, water Poseidon perhaps because it is drunk (ποτός), and earth Demeter because it appears to be the mother of all plants and animals?</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Sophists have invented</s><s id="section4sent2">these names for the elements but the elements themselves are lifeless matter incapable of movement of itself and laid by the Artificer as a substratum for every kind of shape and quality.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">What of the worshippers of the bodies</s><s id="section5sent2">framed from the elements,</s><s id="section5sent3">sun, moon or the other stars fixed or wandering, or the whole heaven and universe?</s><s id="section5sent4">But these too were not brought into being self-made, but through an architect of most perfect knowledge.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">What of the worship of the</s><s id="section6sent2">demi-gods?</s><s id="section6sent3">Surely this is quite ridiculous.</s><s id="section6sent4">How could one and the same person be both mortal and immortal, to say nothing of the reproach attaching to the original source of their birth, tainted as it is with the licentiousness of wanton youth which they impiously dare to ascribe to the blissful and divine powers by supposing that the thrice blessed and exempt from every passion in their infatuation had intercourse with mortal women.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">What</s><s id="section7sent2">of the worshippers of the different kinds of images?</s><s id="section7sent3">Their substance is wood and stone, till a short time ago completely shapeless, hewn away from their congenital structure by quarrymen and woodcutters while their brethren, pieces from the same original source, have become urns and foot-basins or some others of the less honourable vessels which serve the purposes of darkness rather than of light.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">For as for the gods of the Egyptians</s><s id="section8sent2">it is hardly decent even to mention them.</s><s id="section8sent3">The Egyptians have promoted to divine honours irrational animals, not only of the tame sort but also beasts of the utmost savagery, drawn from each of the kinds found below the moon, from the creatures of the land the lion, from those of the water their indigenous crocodile, from the rangers of the air</s><s id="section8sent4">the hawk and the Egyptian ibis.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">And though they</s><s id="section9sent2">see these creatures brought to their birth, requiring food, eating voraciously, full of ordure, venomous too and man-eating, the prey of every sort of disease, and perishing not only by a natural but often by a violent death, they render worship to them, they the civilized to the uncivilized and untamed, the reasonable to the irrational, the kinsfolk of the Godhead to ugliness unmatched even by a Thersites,</s><s id="section9sent3">the rulers and masters to the naturally subservient and slavish.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">These indeed, since they infect not only their</s><s id="section10sent2">own compatriots but the peoples in their neighbourhood with their folly, must remain incurable, for they have lost the use of the most vital of the senses, sight.</s><s id="section10sent3">And by this I do not mean the sight of the body but of the soul, the sight which alone gives a knowledge of truth and falsehood.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">But it is well</s><s id="section11sent2">that the Therapeutae, a people always taught from the first to use their sight, should desire the vision of the Existent and soar above the sun of our senses and never leave their place in this company which carries them on to perfect happiness.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">And those</s><s id="section12sent2">who set themselves to this service, not just following custom nor on the advice and admonition of others but carried away by a heaven-sent passion of love, remain rapt and possessed like bacchanals or cory-bants until they see the object of their yearning.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">Then such is their longing for the deathless</s><s id="section13sent2">and blessed life that thinking their mortal life already ended they abandon their property to their sons or daughters or to other kinsfolk, thus voluntarily advancing the time of their inheritance, while those who have no kinsfolk give them to comrades and friends.</s><s id="section13sent3">For it was right that those who have received ready to their hand the wealth that has eyes to see should surrender the blind wealth to those who are still blind in mind.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">The Greeks extol</s><s id="section14sent2">Anaxagoras and Democritus because smitten with the desire for philosophy they left their fields to be devoured by sheep.</s><s id="section14sent3">I too myself admire them for showing themselves superior to wealth, but how much better are these who did not let their estates serve as feeding-ground for cattle but made good the needs of men, their kinsfolk and friends, and so turned their indigence into affluence.</s><s id="section14sent4">Of the two actions the first was thoughtless, I might say mad, but that the persons concerned have the admiration of Greece, the second showed soberness and careful consideration and remarkable good sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">What</s><s id="section15sent2">more does a hostile army do than cut the crops and hew the trees of their opponents’ country to force them to surrender through lack of necessaries?</s><s id="section15sent3">This is what a Democritus did to his own blood-relations, inflicting on them poverty and indigence artificially created, not perhaps with mischievous intent but through lack of foresight and consideration for the interest of the others.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">How much better and</s><s id="section16sent2">more admirable are these who with no less ardour for the study of wisdom preferred magnanimity to negligence and gave away their possessions instead of wasting them, in this way</s><s id="section16sent3">benefiting both others and themselves, others through supplying them with abundant resources, themselves through furthering the study of philosophy?,</s><s id="section16sent4">For taking care of wealth and possessions consumes time and to economize time is an excellent thing since according to the physician Hippocrates “life is short but art is long.”</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">The</s><s id="section17sent2">same idea is suggested I think by Homer in the Iliad at the beginning of the thirteenth book in the lines</s><s id="section17sent3">The Mysians fighting hand to hand, and noble Mare’s-milk-drinkers—</s><s id="section17sent4">Nought else but milk sustains their life,</s><s id="section17sent5">these men of perfect justice.</s><s id="section17sent6">The idea conveyed is that injustice is bred by anxious thought for the means of life and for money-making, justice by holding and following the opposite creed.</s><s id="section17sent7">The first entails inequality, the second equality, the principle by which nature’s wealth is regulated and so stands superior to the wealth of vain opinion.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">So when they have divested themselves</s><s id="section18sent2">of their possessions and have no longer aught to ensnare them they flee without a backward glance and leave their brothers, their children, their wives, their parents, the wide circle of their kinsfolk, the groups of friends around them, the fatherlands in which they were born and reared, since strong is the attraction of familiarity and very great its power to ensnare.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">And they do not migrate into another</s><s id="section19sent2">city like the unfortunate or worthless slaves who demand to be sold by their owners and so procure a change of masters but not freedom.</s><s id="section19sent3">For every city, even the best governed, is full of turmoils and disturbances innumerable which no one could endure who has ever been even once under the guidance of wisdom.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">Instead of this they pass their days outside</s><s id="section20sent2">the walls pursuing solitude in gardens or lonely bits of country, not from any acquired habit of misanthropical bitterness but because they know how unprofitable and mischievous are associations with persons of dissimilar character.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">This kind exists in many places in the inhabited</s><s id="section21sent2">world, for perfect goodness must needs be shared both by Greeks and the world outside Greece, but it abounds in Egypt in each of the nomes as they are called and especially round Alexandria.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">But the</s><s id="section22sent2">best of these votaries journey from every side to settle in a certain very suitable place which they regard as their fatherland.</s><s id="section22sent3">This place is situated above the Mareotic Lake on a somewhat low-lying hill very happily placed both because of its security and the pleasantly tempered air.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">The safety is</s><s id="section23sent2">secured by the farm buildings and villages round about and the pleasantness of the air by the continuous breezes which arise both from the lake which debouches into the sea and from the open sea hard by.</s><s id="section23sent3">For the sea breezes are light, the lake breezes close and the two combining together produce a most healthy condition of climate.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">The</s><s id="section24sent2">houses of the society thus collected are exceedingly simple, providing protection against two of the most pressing dangers, the fiery heat of the sun and the icy cold of the air.</s><s id="section24sent3">They are neither near together as in towns, since living at close quarters is troublesome and displeasing to people who are seeking to satisfy their desire for solitude, nor yet at a great distance because of the sense of fellowship which they cherish, and to render help to each other if robbers attack them.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">In each house there is a consecrated room</s><s id="section25sent2">which is called a sanctuary or closet</s><s id="section25sent3">and closeted in this they are initiated into the mysteries of the sanctified life.</s><s id="section25sent4">They take nothing into it, either drink or food or any other of the things necessary for the needs of the body, but laws and oracles delivered through the mouth of prophets, and psalms and anything</s><s id="section25sent5">else which fosters and perfects knowledge and piety.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">They keep the memory of God alive and</s><s id="section26sent2">never forget it, so that even in their dreams the picture is nothing else but the loveliness of divine excellences and powers.</s><s id="section26sent3">Indeed many when asleep and dreaming give utterance to the glorious verities of their holy philosophy.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">Twice every day they</s><s id="section27sent2">pray, at dawn and at eventide; at sunrise they pray for a fine bright day, fine and bright in the true sense</s><s id="section27sent3">of the heavenly daylight which they pray may fill their minds.</s><s id="section27sent4">At sunset they ask that the soul may be wholly relieved from the press of the senses and the objects of sense and sitting where she is consistory and council chamber to herself pursue the quest of truth.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">The interval between early morning</s><s id="section28sent2">and evening is spent entirely in spiritual exercise.</s><s id="section28sent3">They read the Holy Scriptures and seek wisdom from their ancestral philosophy by taking it as an allegory,</s><s id="section28sent4">since they think that the words of the literal text are symbols of something whose hidden nature is revealed by studying the underlying meaning.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">They have also writings of men of</s><s id="section29sent2">old, the founders of their way of thinking, who left many memorials of the form</s><s id="section29sent3">used in allegorical interpretation and these they take as a kind of archetype and imitate the method in which this principle is carried out.</s><s id="section29sent4">And so they do not confine themselves to contemplation but also compose hymns and psalms</s><s id="section29sent5">to God in all sorts of metres and melodies which they write down with the rhythms necessarily made more solemn.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">For six days they seek wisdom by themselves in</s><s id="section30sent2">solitude in the closets mentioned above, never passing the outside door of the house or even getting a distant view of it.</s><s id="section30sent3">But every seventh day they meet together as for a general assembly and sit in order according to their age in the proper attitude, with their hands inside the robe, the right hand between the breast and the chin and the left withdrawn along the flank.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Then the senior among them who</s><s id="section31sent2">also has the fullest knowledge of the doctrines which they profess comes forward and with visage and voice alike quiet and composed gives a well-reasoned and wise discourse.</s><s id="section31sent3">He does not make an exhibition of clever rhetoric like the orators or sophists of to-day but follows careful examination by careful expression of the exact meaning of the thoughts, and this does not lodge just outside the ears of the audience but passes through the hearing into the soul and there stays securely.</s><s id="section31sent4">All the others sit still and listen showing their approval merely by their looks or nods.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">This common sanctuary in which</s><s id="section32sent2">they meet every seventh day is a double enclosure, one portion set apart for the use of the men, the other for the women.</s><s id="section32sent3">For women too regularly make part of the audience with the same ardour and the</s><s id="section32sent4">same sense of their calling.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">The wall between the</s><s id="section33sent2">two chambers rises up from the ground to three or four cubits built in the form of a breast work, while the space above up to the roof is left open.</s><s id="section33sent3">This arrangement serves two purposes; the modesty becoming to the female sex is preserved, while the women sitting within ear-shot can easily follow what is said since there is nothing to obstruct the voice of the speaker.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">They lay self-control to be as it were the foundation</s><s id="section34sent2">of their soul and on it build the other virtues.</s><s id="section34sent3">None of them would put food or drink to his lips before sunset since they hold that philosophy finds its right place in the light, the needs of the body in the darkness, and therefore they assign the day to the one and some small part of the night to the other.</s><s id="section34sent4">Some in whom the desire for studying wisdom is more deeply implanted even only after three days remember to take food.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">Others so luxuriate and</s><s id="section35sent2">delight in the banquet of truths which wisdom richly and lavishly supplies that they hold out for twice that time and only after six days do they bring themselves to taste such sustenance as is absolutely necessary.</s><s id="section35sent3">They have become habituated to abstinence like the grasshoppers</s><s id="section35sent4">who are said to live on air because, I suppose, their singing makes their lack of food a light matter.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">But to the seventh day as</s><s id="section36sent2">they consider it to be sacred and festal in the highest degree they have awarded special privileges as its due, and on it after providing for the soul refresh</s><s id="section36sent3">the body also, which they do as a matter of course with the cattle too by releasing them from their continuous labour.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">Still they eat nothing costly,</s><s id="section37sent2">only common bread with salt for a relish flavoured further by the daintier with hyssop, and their drink is spring water.</s><s id="section37sent3">For as nature has set hunger and thirst as mistresses over mortal kind they propitiate them without using anything to curry favour but only such things as are actually needed and without which life cannot be maintained.</s><s id="section37sent4">Therefore they eat enough to keep from hunger and drink enough to keep from thirst but abhor surfeiting as a malignant enemy both to soul and body.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">As for</s><s id="section38sent2">the two forms of shelter, clothes and housing, we have already said that the house is unembellished and a makeshift constructed for utility only.</s><s id="section38sent3">Their clothing likewise is the most inexpensive, enough to protect them against extreme cold and heat, a thick coat of shaggy skin</s><s id="section38sent4">in winter and in summer a vest or linen shirt.</s></p></div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">For they practise an all-round</s><s id="section39sent2">simplicity knowing that its opposite, vanity,</s><s id="section39sent3">is the source of falsehood as simplicity is of truth, and that both play the part of a fountain head of other things, since from falsehood flow the manifold forms of evil and from truth abundant streams of goodness both human and divine.</s></p></div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">I wish also to speak of their common assemblages</s><s id="section40sent2">and the cheerfulness of their convivial meals as contrasted with those of other people.</s><s id="section40sent3">Some people when they have filled themselves with strong drink behave as though they had drunk not wine but some witch’s potion</s><s id="section40sent4">charged with frenzy and madness and anything more fatal that can be imagined to overthrow their reason.</s><s id="section40sent5">They bellow and rave like wild dogs, attack and bite each other and gnaw off noses, ears, fingers and some other parts of the body,</s><s id="section40sent6">so that they make good the story of the comrades of Odysseus and the Cyclops by eating “gobbets”</s><s id="section40sent7">of men, as the poet says, and with greater cruelty than the Cyclops.</s></p></div>
<div n="41" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">For he avenged himself on men whom</s><s id="section41sent2">he suspected to be enemies, they on their familiars and friends and sometimes even on their kin over the salt and across the board, and as they pour the</s><s id="section41sent3">libation of peace they commit deeds of war</s><s id="section41sent4">like those of the gymnastic contests, counterfeiting the genuine coin of manly exercise, no wrestlers but wretches, for that is the right name to give them.</s></p></div>
<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">For what</s><s id="section42sent2">the athletes do in the arena while sober, in the daylight, with the eyes of all Greece upon them, in the hope of victory and the crown and in the exercise of their skill, are debased by the revellers who ply their activities in convivial gatherings by night and in darkness, drink-besotted, ignorant and skilful only for mischief to inflict dishonour, insult and grievous outrage on the objects of their assault.</s></p></div>
<div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section43"><s id="section43sent1">And if no</s><s id="section43sent2">one plays the umpire and comes forward to intervene and separate them they carry on the bout with increased licence to the finish, ready both to kill and to be killed.</s><s id="section43sent3">For they suffer no less than what they mete to others though they know it not, so infatuated are these who shrink not from drinking wine, as the comic poet says, to mar not only their neighbours but themselves.</s></p></div>
<div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section44"><s id="section44sent1">And so those who but</s><s id="section44sent2">now came to the party sound in body and friendly at heart leave soon afterwards in enmity and with bodily mutilation,—enmity in some cases calling for advocates and judges, mutilation in others requiring the apothecary and physician and the help that they can bring.</s></p></div>
<div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section45"><s id="section45sent1">Others belonging to what we may</s><s id="section45sent2">suppose is the more moderate part of the company are in a state of overflow.</s><s id="section45sent3">Draughts of strong wine act upon them like mandragora, they throw the left</s><s id="section45sent4">elbow forward, turn the neck at a right angle, belch into the cups and sink into a profound sleep, seeing nothing and hearing nothing, having apparently only one sense and that the most slavish, taste.</s></p></div>
<div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section46"><s id="section46sent1">I know</s><s id="section46sent2">of some who when they are half-seas-over and before they have completely gone under arrange donations and subscriptions in preparation for to-morrow’s bout, considering that one factor in their present exhilaration is the hope of future intoxication.</s></p></div>
<div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section47"><s id="section47sent1">In this way</s><s id="section47sent2">they spend their whole life ever hearthless and homeless, enemies to their parents, their wives and their children, enemies too to their country and at war with themselves.</s><s id="section47sent3">For a loose and a dissolute life is a menace to all.</s></p></div>
