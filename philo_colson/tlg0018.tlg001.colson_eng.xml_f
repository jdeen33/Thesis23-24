On the Account of the World’s Creation Given by Moses
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">While among other lawgivers some have nakedly and without embellishment drawn up a code of the things held to be right among their people, and others, dressing up their ideas in much irrelevant and cumbersome matter, have befogged the masses and hidden the truth under their fictions,</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">Moses, disdaining either course, the one as devoid of the philosopher’s painstaking effort to explore his subject thoroughly, the other as full of falsehood and imposture, introduced his laws with an admirable and most impressive exordium.</s><s id="section2sent2">He refrained, on the one hand, from stating abruptly what should be practised or avoided, and on the other hand, in face of the necessity of preparing the minds of those who were to live under the laws for their reception, he refrained from inventing myths himself or acquiescing in those composed by others.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">His exordium, as I have said, is one that excites our admiration in the highest degree.</s><s id="section3sent2">It consists of an account of the creation of the world, implying that the world is in harmony with the Law, and the Law with the world, and that the man who observes the law is constituted thereby a loyal citizen of the world,</s><s id="section3sent3">regulating his doings by the purpose and will of Nature, in accordance with which the entire world itself also is administered.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Now it is true that no writer in verse or prose could possibly do justice to the beauty of the ideas embodied in this account of the creation of the kosmos.</s><s id="section4sent2">For they transcend our capacity of speech and of hearing, being too great and august to be adjusted to the tongue or ear of any mortal.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">οNevertheless they must not on this account be passed over in silence.</s><s id="section5sent2">Nay, for the sake of the God-beloved author we must be venturesome even beyond our power.</s><s id="section5sent3">We shall fetch nothing from our own store, but, with a great array of points before us, we shall mention only a few, such as we may believe to be within reach of the human mind when possessed by love and longing for wisdom.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">The minutest seal takes in under the graver’s hand the contours of colossal figures.</s><s id="section6sent2">So perchance shall the beauties of the world’s creation recorded in the Laws, transcendent as they are and dazzling as they do by their bright gleams the souls of readers, be indicated by delineations minute and slight.</s><s id="section6sent3">But first we must draw attention to a matter which ought not to be passed over in silence.</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">There are some people who, having the world in admiration rather than the Maker of the world, pronounce it to be without beginning and everlasting, while with impious falsehood they postulate in God a vast inactivity; whereas we ought on the contrary to be astonied at His powers as Maker and Father, and not to assign to the world a disproportionate majesty.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">Moses, both because he had attained the very summit of philosophy, and because he had been divinely instructed in the greater and most essential part of Nature’s lore, could not fail to recognize that the universal must consist of two parts; one part</s><s id="section8sent2">active Cause and the other passive object; and that the active Cause is the perfectly pure and unsullied Mind of the universe, transcending virtue, transcending knowledge, transcending the good itself and the beautiful itself;</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">while the passive part is in itself incapable of life and motion, but, when set in motion and shaped and quickened by Mind, changes into the most perfect masterpiece, namely this world.</s><s id="section9sent2">Those who assert that this world is unoriginate unconsciously eliminate that which of all incentives to piety is the most beneficial and the most indispensable, namely providence.</s><s id="section9sent3">For it stands to reason that what has been brought into existence should be cared for by its Father and Maker.</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">For, as we know, it is a father’s aim in regard of his offspring and an artificer’s in regard of his handiwork to preserve them, and by every means to fend off from them aught that may entail loss or harm.</s><s id="section10sent2">He keenly desires to provide for them in every way all that is beneficial and to their advantage: but between that which has never been brought into being and one who is not its</s><s id="section10sent3">Maker no such tie is formed.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">It is a worthless and baleful doctrine, setting up anarchy in the well-ordered realm of the world, leaving it without protector, arbitrator, or judge, without anyone whose office it is to administer and direct all its affairs.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">Not so Moses.</s><s id="section12sent2">That great master,
holding the unoriginate to be of a different order from that which is visible, since everything that is an object of sensible perception is subject to becoming and to constant change, never abiding in the same state, assigned to that which is invisible and an object of intellectual apprehension the infinite and undefinable
as united with it by closest tie; but on that which</s><s id="section12sent3">is an object of the senses he bestowed “genesis,”
“becoming,” as its appropriate name.</s><s id="section12sent4">Seeing then that this world is both visible and perceived by the senses, it follows that it must also have had an origin.</s><s id="section12sent5">Whence it was entirely to the point that he put on record that origin, setting forth in its true grandeur the work of God.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">He says that in six days the world was created, not that its Maker required a length of time for His work, for we must think of God as doing all things simultaneously, remembering that “all” includes with the commands which He issues the thought behind them.</s><s id="section13sent2">Six days are mentioned because for the things coming into existence there was need of order.</s><s id="section13sent3">Order involves number, and among numbers by the laws of nature the most suitable to productivity is 6, for if we start with 1 it is the first perfect number, being equal to the product of its factors (i.e. 1 x 2 x 3), as well as made up of the sum of them (i.e. 1 +2+3), its half being 3, its third part 2, its sixth part 1.</s><s id="section13sent4">We may say that it is in its nature both male and female, and is a result of the distinctive power of either.</s><s id="section13sent5">For among things that are it is the odd that is male, and the even female.</s><s id="section13sent6">Now of odd numbers 3 is the starting-point, and of even numbers 2, and the product of these two is 6.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">For it was requisite that the world, being most perfect of all things that have come into existence, should be constituted in accordance with a perfect number, namely six; and, inasmuch as it was to have in itself beings that sprang from a coupling together, should receive the impress of a mixed number, namely the first in which odd and even</s><s id="section14sent2">were combined, one that should contain the essential principle both of the male that sows and of the female that receives the seed.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">Now to each of the days</s><s id="section15sent2">He assigned some of the portions of the whole, not including, however, the first day, which He does not even call “first,” lest it should be reckoned with the others, but naming it “one”</s><s id="section15sent3">He designates it by a name which precisely hits the mark, for He discerned in it and expressed by the title which</s><s id="section15sent4">He gives it the nature and appellation of the unit, or the “one.”</s><s id="section15sent5">We must recount as many as we can of the elements embraced in it.</s><s id="section15sent6">To recount them all would be impossible.</s><s id="section15sent7">Its pre-eminent element is the intelligible world, as is shown in the treatise dealing with the “One.”</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">For God, being God, assumed that a beautiful copy would never be produced apart from a beautiful pattern, and that no object of perception would be faultless which was not made in the likeness of an original discerned only by the intellect.</s><s id="section16sent2">So when</s><s id="section16sent3">He willed to create this visible world</s><s id="section16sent4">He first fully formed the intelligible world, in order that He might have the use of a pattern wholly God-like and incorporeal in producing the material world, as a later creation, the very image of an earlier, to embrace in itself objects of perception of as many kinds as the other contained objects of intelligence.</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">To speak of or conceive that world which consists of ideas as being in some place is illegitimate; how it consists (of them) we shall know if we carefully attend to some image supplied by the things of our world.</s><s id="section17sent2">When a city is being founded to satisfy the soaring ambition of some king or governor, who lays claim to despotic power and</s><s id="section17sent3">being magnificent in his ideas would fain add a fresh lustre to his good fortune, there comes forward now and again some trained architect who, observing the favourable climate and convenient position of the site, first sketches in his own mind wellnigh all the parts of the city that is to be wrought out, temples, gymnasia, town-halls, market-places, harbours, docks, streets, walls to be built, dwelling-houses as well as public buildings to be set up.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Thus after having received in his own soul, as it were in wax, the figures of these objects severally, he carries about the image of a city which is the creation of his mind.</s><s id="section18sent2">Then by his innate power of memory, he recalls the images of the various parts of this city, and imprints their types yet more distinctly in it: and like a good craftsman he begins to build the city of stones and timber, keeping his eye upon his pattern and making the visible and tangible objects correspond in each case to the incorporeal ideas.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Just such must be our thoughts about God.</s><s id="section19sent2">We must suppose that, when He was minded to found the one great city, He conceived beforehand the models of its parts, and that out of these</s><s id="section19sent3">He constituted and brought to completion a world discernible only by the mind, and then, with that for a pattern, the world which our senses can perceive.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">As, then, the city which was fashioned beforehand within the mind of the architect held no place in the outer world, but had been engraved in the soul of the artificer as by a seal; even so the universe that consisted of ideas would have no other location than the Divine Reason, which was the Author of this ordered frame.</s><s id="section20sent2">For what other place could there be for His powers sufficient to receive and</s><s id="section20sent3">contain, I say not all but, any one of them whatever uncompounded and untempered?</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">Now
just such a power is that by which the universe was made, one that has as its source nothing less than true goodness.</s><s id="section21sent2">For should one conceive a wish to search for the cause, for the sake of which this whole was created, it seems to me that he would not be wrong in saying, what indeed one of the men of old did say, that the Father and Maker of all is good; and because of this He grudged not a share in his own excellent nature to an existence which has of itself nothing fair and lovely, while it is capable of becoming all things.</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">For of itself it was without order, without quality, without soul, (without likeness); it was full of inconsistency, ill-adjustment, disharmony: but it was capable of turning and undergoing a complete change to the best, the very contrary of all these, to order, quality, life, correspondence, identity, likeness, perfect adjustment, to harmony, to all that is characteristic of the more excellent model.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">Now God, with no counsellor to help Him (who was there beside Him?) determined that it was meet to confer rich and unrestricted benefits upon that nature which apart from Divine bounty could obtain of itself no good thing.</s><s id="section23sent2">But not in proportion to the greatest of His own bounties does</s><s id="section23sent3">He confer benefits—for these are without end or limit—but in proportion to the capacities of the recipients.</s><s id="section23sent4">For it is not the nature of creation to receive good treatment in like manner as it is the nature of God to bestow it, seeing that the powers of God are overwhelmingly vast, whereas creation, being too feeble to entertain their abundance, would</s><s id="section23sent5">have broken down under the effort to do so, had not God with appropriate adjustment dealt out to each his due portion.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">Should a man desire
to use words in a more simple and direct way, he would say that the world discerned only by the intellect is nothing else than the Word of God when He was already engaged in the act of creation.</s><s id="section24sent2">For (to revert to our illustration) the city discernible by the intellect alone is nothing else than the reasoning faculty of the architect in the act of planning to found the city.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">It is Moses who lays down this, not  Witness his express acknowledgement in the sequel, when setting on record the creation of man, that he was moulded after the image of God (Gen. i. 27).</s><s id="section25sent2">Now if the part is an image of an image, it is manifest that the whole is so too, and if the whole creation, this entire world perceived by our senses (seeing that it is greater than any human image) is a copy of the Divine image, it is manifest that the archetypal seal also, which we aver to be the world descried by the mind, would be the very Word of God.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">Then he says that “in the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,” taking “beginning”
not, as some think, in a chronological sense, for time there was not before there was a world.</s><s id="section26sent2">Time began either simultaneously with the world or after it.</s><s id="section26sent3">For since time is a measured space</s><s id="section26sent4">determined by the world’s movement, and since movement could not be prior to the object moving, but must of necessity arise either after it or simultaneously with it, it follows of necessity that time also is either coeval with or later born than the world.</s><s id="section26sent5">To venture to affirm that it is elder born would be to do violence to philosophic sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">And since the word “beginning”</s><s id="section27sent2">is not here taken as the chronological beginning, it would seem likely that the numerical order is indicated, so that “in the beginning He made” is equivalent to “He made the heaven first”: for it is indeed reasonable that it should come into existence first, being both best of created things and made from the purest of all that is,</s><s id="section27sent3">seeing that it was destined to be the most holy dwelling-place of manifest and visible gods.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">For, even if the Maker made all things simultaneously, order was none the less an attribute of all that came into existence in fair beauty, for beauty is absent where there is disorder.</s><s id="section28sent2">Now order is a series of things going on before and following after, in due sequence, a sequence which, though not seen in the finished productions, yet exists in the designs of the contrivers; for only so could these things be fashioned with perfect accuracy, and work without leaving their path or clashing with each other.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">First, then, the Maker made an incorporeal heaven, and an invisible earth, and the essential form of air and void.</s><s id="section29sent2">To the one he gave the name of “Darkness,” since the air when left to itself, is black.</s><s id="section29sent3">The other he named “abyss,” for the void is a region of immensity and vast depths.</s><s id="section29sent4">Next (He made) the incorporeal essence of water and of life-breath and, to crown all, of light.</s><s id="section29sent5">This again, the seventh in order, was an incorporeal pattern, discernible only by the mind, of the sun and of all luminaries which were to come into existence throughout heaven.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Special distinction is accorded by Moses to life-breath and to light.</s><s id="section30sent2">The one he entitles the “breath” of God, because breath is most life-giving, and of life God is the author, while</s><s id="section30sent3">of light he says that it is beautiful pre-eminently (Gen. i. 4): for the intelligible as far surpasses the visible in the brilliancy of its radiance, as sunlight assuredly surpasses darkness and day night, and mind, the ruler of the entire soul, the bodily eyes.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">Now that invisible light perceptible only by mind has come into being as an image of the Divine Word Who brought it within our ken: it is a supercelestial constellation, fount of the constellations obvious to sense.</s><s id="section31sent2">It would not be amiss to term it “all-brightness,”
to signify that from which sun and moon, as well as fixed stars and planets draw, in proportion to their several capacity, the light befitting each of them: for that pure and undiluted radiance is bedimmed
so soon as it begins to undergo the change that is entailed by the passage from the intelligible to the sensibly discerned, for no object of sense is free from dimness.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">Right too is his statement that “darkness was above the abyss” (Gen. i. 2).</s><s id="section32sent2">For in a sense the air is over the void, inasmuch as it has spread over and completely filled the immensity and desolation of the void, of all that reaches from the zone of the moon to us.</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">After the kindling of the intelligible light, which preceded the sun’s creation, darkness its adversary withdrew: for God, in His perfect knowledge of their mutual contrariety and natural conflict, parted them one from another by a wall of separation.</s><s id="section33sent2">In order, therefore, to keep them from the discord arising from perpetual clash, to prevent war in place of peace prevailing and setting up disorder in an ordered universe, He not only separated light and darkness, but also placed in the intervening spaces boundary-marks, by which He held back each</s><s id="section33sent3">of their extremities: for, had they been actual neighbours, they were sure to produce confusion by engaging with intense and never-ceasing rivalry in the struggle for mastery.</s><s id="section33sent4">As it was, their assault on one another was broken and kept back by barriers set up between them.</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">These barriers are evening and dawn.</s><s id="section34sent2">The latter, gently restraining the darkness, anticipates the sunrise with the glad tidings of its approach; while evening, supervening upon sunset, gives a gentle welcome to the oncoming mass of darkness.</s><s id="section34sent3">We must, however, place these, dawn and evening I mean, in the category of the incorporeal and intelligible: for there is in these nothing whatever patent to the senses, but they are simply models and measuring-rules and patterns and seals, all of these being incorporeal and serving for the creation of other bodies.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">When light had come into being, and darkness had moved out of its way and retired, and evening and dawn had been fixed as barriers in the intervals between them, as a necessary consequence a measure of time was forthwith brought about, which its Maker called Day, and not
“first” day but “one,” an expression due to the uniqueness of the intelligible world, and to its having therefore a natural kinship to the number
“One.”</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">The incorporeal world, then, was now finished and firmly settled in the Divine Reason, and the world patent to sense was ripe for birth after the pattern of the incorporeal.</s><s id="section36sent2">And first of its parts, best of them all, the Creator proceeded to make the Heaven, which with strict truth he entitled firmament, as being corporeal: for the body is naturally solid, seeing that it has a threefold dimension.</s><s id="section36sent3">What else</s><s id="section36sent4">indeed do we conceive a solid object and a body to be, but that which extends in each direction?</s><s id="section36sent5">Fitly then, in contradistinction to the incorporeal and purely intelligible, did He call this body-like heaven perceived by our senses “the solid firmament.”</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">After so designating it He went on forthwith to speak of it as “heaven.”</s><s id="section37sent2">He did so with unerring propriety, either because it is the “boundary”
of all things, or because it came into being first of things “visible.”</s><s id="section37sent3">When the heaven had been created he names a second day, thus assigning to heaven the whole space and interval of a day.</s><s id="section37sent4">He does this by reason of the position of dignity which heaven occupies among the objects of sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">At this stage, then, water in all its volume had been poured forth over all the earth, and had found its way through all its parts, as through a sponge saturated with moisture.</s><s id="section38sent2">It had produced swamps and deep mud, earth and water being mingled together and kneaded, like a mass of dough, into a single element without shape or distinction of its parts.</s><s id="section38sent3">So God next bids all the briny water, which would have been the cause of barrenness to crops and trees, to be gathered together by flowing to the same point from the pores of the whole earth, and the dry land to appear.</s><s id="section38sent4">The moisture of the fresh sweet part was left behind to secure its permanence, since, when supplied in fit quantity, this sweet moisture served as a cohesive to the separate parts.</s><s id="section38sent5">This was to prevent it from being entirely dried up, and so becoming unproductive and barren, and enable it like a mother to provide, as for offspring, not one only of the two kinds of nourishment, namely solid food, but both kinds, food and</s><s id="section38sent6">drink.</s><s id="section38sent7">Wherefore the earth had abounding veins like breasts.</s><s id="section38sent8">These when opened would pour forth rivers and springs.</s></p></div>
