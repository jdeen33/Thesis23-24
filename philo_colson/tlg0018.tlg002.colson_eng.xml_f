Allegorical Interpretation of Genesis <milestone n="2" unit="altchapter"></milestone>, <milestone n="2" unit="altchapter"></milestone>
<div id="Book-1" n="1" subtype="book" type="textpart">
Book I
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section2sent1">“And the heaven and the earth and all their world were completed” (Gen. ii. 1). He had already told of the creation of mind and sense-perception;
he now fully sets forth the consummation of both.</s><s id="Book1section2sent2">He does not say that either the individual mind or the particular sense-perception have reached completion, but that the originals have done so, that of mind and that of sense-perception.</s><s id="Book1section2sent3">For using symbolical language he calls the mind heaven, since heaven is the abode of natures discerned only by mind, but sense-perception he calls earth, because sense-perception possesses a composition of a more earthly and body-like sort.</s><s id="Book1section2sent4">“World,”in the case of mind, means all incorporeal things, things discerned by mind alone: in the case of sense-perception it denotes things in bodily form and generally whatever sense perceives.</s></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section3sent1">“And God finished on the sixthday His works which He had made” (Gen. ii. 2).It is quite foolish to think that the world was created in six days or in a space of time at all.</s><s id="Book1section3sent2">Why?</s><s id="Book1section3sent3">Because every period of time is a series of days and nights, and these can only be made such by the movement of the sun as it goes over and under the earth: butthe sun is a part of heaven, so that time is confessedly more recent than the world.</s><s id="Book1section3sent4">It would therefore be correct to say that the world was not made in time, but that time was formed by means of the world, for it was heaven’s movement that was the index of the nature of time.</s></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section4sent1">When, then, Moses says, “He finished His work on the sixth day,” we must understand him to be adducing not a quantity of days, but a perfect number, namely six, since it is the first that is equal to the sum of its own fractions ½, ⅓, and 1/6, and is produced by the multiplication of two unequal factors,2 × 3; and see, the numbers 2 and 3 have left behind the incorporeal character that belongs to 1, 2 being an image of matter, and being parted and divided as that is, while 3 is the image of a solid body, for the solid is patient of a threefold division.</s></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section5sent1">Nay more, the number 6 is akin to the movements of animals provided with instrumental limbs,for the body equipped with such instruments is so constituted by nature that it can move in six directions, forwards and backwards, upwards and downwards, to the right and to the left.</s><s id="Book1section5sent2">Moses’ wish, therefore, is to exhibit alike the things created of mortal kind and those that are incorruptible as having been formed in a way corresponding to their proper numbers.</s><s id="Book1section5sent3">As I have just said, he makes mortal things parallel with the number six, the happy and blessed things with the number seven.</s></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section6sent1">First of all, then, on the seventh day the Creator, having brought to an end the formation of mortal things, begins the shaping of others more divine.</s><s id="Book1section6sent2">For God never leaves off making, but even as it is the property of fire to burn and of snow to chill, so it is the property of God to make: nay more soby far, inasmuch as He is to all besides the source of action.</s></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section7sent1">Excellently, moreover, does Moses say “caused to rest” not “rested”; for He causes to rest that which, though actually not in operation, is apparently making, but He Himself never ceases making.</s><s id="Book1section7sent2">For this reason Moses adds after “He caused to rest” the words “from what He had begun.”For whereas things produced by human arts when finished stand still and remain as they are, the products of divine skill, when completed, begin again to move; for their endings are the beginnings of other things, as the end of day is the beginning of night, and the openings of a month and of a year must naturally be regarded as limits which close those which have elapsed:</s></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section8sent1">birth again is accomplished through other things decaying, and decay through fresh births, showing the truth of the saying:Naught that is born doth ever die,
Its severed parts together fly,
And yield another shape.</s></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section9sent1">Nature takes delight in the number seven.</s><s id="Book1section9sent2">Thus there are seven planets, the counterpoise to the uniform movement of the fixed stars.</s><s id="Book1section9sent3">It is in seven stars that the bear reaches completeness, and gives rise not to commerce only but to fellowship and unity among men.</s><s id="Book1section9sent4">The changes of the moon, again, occur by sevens: this is the luminary most sympathetic to earthly matters.</s><s id="Book1section9sent5">And such changes as Nature produces in the atmosphere, she effects mainly by the influence of figures dominated by seven.</s></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section10sent1">Indeed,all that concerns us mortals has a divine origin drawn from heaven and is for our weal when its movement is ruled by seven.</s><s id="Book1section10sent2">Who does not know that seven months’ infants come to the birth, while those that have taken a longer time, remaining in the womb eight months, are as a rule still-born?</s></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section11sent1">And they say that man becomes a reasoning being during his first seven years, by which time he is already capable of expressing ordinary nouns and verbs through having acquired the reasoning faculty; and that during his second period of seven years he reaches complete consummation; consummation meaning the power of reproducing his like; for at about the age of fourteen we are able to beget offspring like ourselves.</s><s id="Book1section11sent2">The third period of seven years, again, is the end of growth, for till the age of twenty-one years men increase in height, and by many this time is called his prime.</s></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section12sent1">Furthermore the unreasoning side of the soul consists of seven parts, five senses, and the organ of speech, and the genital organ.</s></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section13sent1">The body again has seven movements, six mechanical, the seventh circular.</s><s id="Book1section13sent2">Seven also are the internal organs, stomach, heart, spleen, liver, lung, two kidneys.</s><s id="Book1section13sent3">Of equal number in like number are the divisions of the body—head,
neck, breast, hands, belly, abdomen, feet.</s><s id="Book1section13sent4">And the face, the living creature’s noblest part, is pierced by seven apertures, by two eyes, and two ears, as many nostrils, and the mouth, which make up seven.</s></p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section14sent1">The excrements are seven—tears, mucus, spittle, seed, superfluities discharged by two ducts, and the sweat that oozes from all over the body.</s><s id="Book1section14sent2">Once again in diseases the seventh is the most critical day.</s><s id="Book1section14sent3">And the monthly purgings of women extend to seven days.</s></p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section15sent1">The powerof this number reaches also to the most beneficent of the arts: in grammar, for instance, the best and most effective of the letters, namely the vowels, are seven in number; in music we may fairly call the seven-stringed lyre the best of instruments, because the enharmonic genus, which as we know is the most dignified of those used in melodies, is best brought out when that instrument renders it.</s><s id="Book1section15sent2">Sevenfold are the modulations in pronunciation—acute, grave, circumflex, aspirated and unaspirated, long, short.</s></p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section16sent1">Further, seven is the first number after the perfect number six, and the same in some sort with the number one.</s><s id="Book1section16sent2">Whereas other numbers within the decade are either produced by or produce those within the decade and the decade itself, the number seven neither produces any of the numbers within the decade nor is produced by any.</s><s id="Book1section16sent3">By reason of this the Pythagoreans, indulging in myth, liken seven to the motherless and ever-virgin Maiden, because neither was she born of the womb nor shall she ever bear.</s></p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section17sent1">“He restedtherefore on the seventh day from all His works which He had made” (Gen. ii. 2).</s></p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section18sent1">This is as much as to say that God ceases moulding the masses that are mortal, whenever He begins to make those that are divine and in keeping with the nature of seven.</s><s id="Book1section18sent2">But the interpretation of the statement in accordance with its bearing on human life and character is this, that, whenever there comes upon the soul the holy Reason of which Seven is the keynote, six together with all mortal things that the soul seems to make therewith comes to a stop.</s><s id="Book1section18sent3">“And God blessed the seventh day andhallowed it” (Gen. ii. 3).God both blesses and forthwith makes holy the dispositions set in motion in harmony with the seventh and truly Divine light, for closely akin are the character that is charged with benedictionand the character that is holy.</s><s id="Book1section18sent4">That is why, when treating of him who has vowed the great vow,he says that, if a change suddenly befall him and defile his mind,he shall no longer be holy, but “the preceding days are not reckoned.</s><s id="Book1section18sent5">”Rightly enough, for the character that is not holy is vile, of no account, so that the character well accounted of is holy.</s></p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section19sent1">Rightly, then, did he say that God both blessed and hallowed the seventh day, “because in it He ceasedfrom all His works which God began to make” (Gen. ii. 3).But the reason why the man that guides himself in accordance with the seventh and perfect light is both of good understandingand holy, is that the formation of things mortal ceases with this day’s advent.</s><s id="Book1section19sent2">For, indeed, the matter stands thus; when that most brilliant and truly divine light of virtue has dawned, the creation of that whose nature is of the contrary kind comes to a stop.</s><s id="Book1section19sent3">But we pointed out that God when ceasing or rather causing to cease, does not cease making, but begins the creating of other things, sinceHe is not a mere artificer, but also Father of the things that are coming into being.</s></p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section20sent1">“This book is that of the origin of heaven and earth, when it came into being” (Gen. ii.4).</s><s id="Book1section20sent2">(That is to say): “This perfect Reason,moving in accord with the number 7, is the primal origin both of mind ordering itself after the original patterns, and of sense-perception in the domain of mind(if the expression is permissible) ordering itself after those originals.</s><s id="Book1section20sent3">”“Book” is Moses’ name for the Reason of God, in which have been inscribed and engraved the formation of all else.</s></p></div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section21sent1">But that you may not suppose that the Deity makes anything in definite periods of time, but may know that to mortal kind the process of creation is unobserved, un-descried,
incomprehensible, he adds, “When it came into being,” not defining “when” by a determining limit, for the things that come into being under the hand of the First Cause come into being with no determining limit.</s><s id="Book1section21sent2">There is an end, then, of the notion that the universe came into being in six days.</s></p></div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section22sent1">“In the day in which God made the heaven and the earth and every green thing of the field before it appeared upon the earth and all grass of the field before it sprang up; for God had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the earth”
(Gen. ii. 4, 5).Above he has called this day a book, for he delineates the creation of heaven and earth as wrought in both: for by His own supremely manifest and far-shining Reason God makes both of them, both the original of the mind, which in symbolic language he calls “heaven,” and the original of sense-perception, to which by a figure he gave the name of
“earth.”</s></p></div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section23sent1">And he compares the original of the mind and the original of sense-perception to two fields; for they bear fruit, the mind all that is done in thinking, sense-perception all that is done in perceiving.</s><s id="Book1section23sent2">What he means is something of this sort.</s><s id="Book1section23sent3">As before the particular and individual mind there subsists a certain original as an archetype and pattern of it, and again before the particular sense-perception, a certain original of sense-perception related to the particular as a seal making impression is to the form which it makes; just so, before the individual objects of intellectual perception came into being, there was existing as a genus the ‘intellectually-perceptible’ itself, by participation in which the name has been given to the members of the genus; and before the individual objects of sense-perception came into existence, there was existing as a genus the ‘sensibly-perceptible’ itself, by sharing in whose being all other objects of sense have become such.</s></p></div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section24sent1">“Green of the field,”
then, is what he terms the “intellectually-perceptible” of the mind; for as in a field the green things spring up and bloom, even so the ‘intellectually-perceptible’
is a growth springing from the mind.</s><s id="Book1section24sent2">Before, then, the particular ‘intellectually-perceptible’ came into being, the Creator produces the solely abstract ‘intellectually-perceptible,’ as a generic existence.</s><s id="Book1section24sent3">This he rightly calls “all,” for the particular ‘intellectually-perceptible,’ being a fragment, is not all, but the generic is so, being a full whole.</s></p></div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section25sent1">“And all the grass of the field”
he says, “before it sprang up,” that is to say, before the particular objects of sense sprang up, there existed by the Maker’s forethought the generic ‘sensibly-perceptible,’ and that it is that he again calls “all.</s><s id="Book1section25sent2">”Natural enough is his comparison of the ‘sensibly-perceptible’ to grass.</s><s id="Book1section25sent3">For as grass is the food of a creature devoid of reason, so has the‘sensibly-perceptible’ been assigned to the unreasoning part of the soul.</s><s id="Book1section25sent4">Else why, after saying before “green of the field,” does he go on to say,
“and all grass,” as if it were impossible for green of the field to come up as grass?</s><s id="Book1section25sent5">The fact is, “the green of the field” is the ‘intellectually-perceptible,’ an outgrowth of the mind, but the “grass” is the ‘sensibly-perceptible,’ it in turn being a growth of the unreasoning part of the soul.</s></p></div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section26sent1">He goes on “for God had not rained upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.</s><s id="Book1section26sent2">”These words discover a deep knowledge of the laws of being.</s><s id="Book1section26sent3">For if God does not shower upon the senses the means of apprehending objects presented to them, neither will the mind have anything to “work” or take in hand in the field of sense-perception.</s></p></div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section27sent1">For the mind by itself is without employment when the Cause of all things does not pour down, like rain and moisture, colours on the sight, sounds on the hearing, savours on the taste, and that which is proper to them on the other senses.</s><s id="Book1section27sent2">But as soon as God has begun to water sense with objects of sense, that moment the mind also is found to be a tiller of rich soil, so to speak.</s><s id="Book1section27sent3">The original of ‘sense-perception’ has no need of nourishment; but the nourishment of ‘sense-perception,’
which he figuratively calls “rain,” is the particular objects of sense, which of course are bodies; whereas an original has nothing to do with bodies.</s><s id="Book1section27sent4">Thus before the creation of particular concrete substances, God did not rain on the original idea of sense-perception, which Moses calls “earth,”
and this means that He supplied it with no food: for indeed it was in absolutely no need whatever of a sensible object of perception.</s></p></div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section28sent1">Themeaning of the words, “and there was not a man to work the ground,” is this: the original idea of the mind did not work the original idea of sense-perception: for my mind like yours works the sense-perception through the objects of the senses, but the original idea of the mind, as there was of course no particular body in existence proper to it, does not work the original idea of ‘sense-perception’: for were it working, it would be working it by means of the objects of sense, but among original ideas there is no such thing as an object of sense.</s></p></div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section29sent1">“And a spring went up out of the earth and watered all the face of the earth” (Gen. ii. 6).He calls the mind a “spring” of the earth, and the senses its “face,” because Nature, exercising forethought in all things, assigned this place to them out of all the body as most suitable for their special activities: and the mind like a spring waters the senses, sending to each of them the streams suitable to it.</s><s id="Book1section29sent2">See then, how, like links in a chain, the powers of the living creature hold on to each other; for mind and ‘sense-perception’ and object of sense being three, ‘sense-perception’ is in the middle, while mind and object of sense occupy each extreme.</s></p></div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section30sent1">But neither has the mind power to work, that is, to put forth its energies by way of ‘sense-perception,’ unless God send the object of sense as rain upon it; nor is any benefit derived from the object of sense when so rained down, unless, like a spring, the mind, extending itself to reach the ‘sense-perception,’ stir it out of its repose to grasp the object presented to it.</s><s id="Book1section30sent2">Thus the mind and the object of sense are always practising a reciprocity of giving, the one lying ready for sense-perception as its material, theother, like a craftsman, moving sense-perception in the direction of the external object, to produce an impulse towards it.</s></p></div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section31sent1">For the living creature excels the non-living in two respects, in the power of receiving impressions and in the active impulsetowards the object producing them.</s><s id="Book1section31sent2">The impression is produced by the drawing nigh of the external object, as it stamps the mind through sense-perception; while the active impulse, close of kin to the power aforesaid, comes about by way of the mind’s power of self-extension, which it exercises through sense-perception, and so comes into touch with the object presented to it, and goes towards it, striving to reach and seize it.</s></p></div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section32sent1">“And God formed the man by taking clay from the earth, and breathed into his face a breath of life, and the man became a living soul” (Gen. ii. 7).There are two types of men; the one a heavenly man, the other an earthly.</s><s id="Book1section32sent2">The heavenly man, being made after the image of God, is altogether without part or lot in corruptible and terrestrial substance; but the earthly one was compacted out of the matter scattered here and there, which Moses calls “clay.</s><s id="Book1section32sent3">”For this reason he says that the heavenly man was not moulded, but was stamped with the image of God; while the earthly is a moulded work of the Artificer, but not His offspring.</s></p></div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section33sent1">We must account the man made out of the earth to be mind mingling with, but not yet blended with, body.</s><s id="Book1section33sent2">But this earthlike mind is in reality also corruptible, were not God to breathe into it a power of real life; when He does so, it does not any more undergo moulding, but becomes a soul, not an inefficient and imperfectly formed soul, but oneendowed with mind and actually alive; for he says,
“man became a living soul.”</s></p></div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section34sent1">The question might be asked, why God deemed the earthly and body-loving mind worthy of divine breath at all, but not the mind which had been created after the original, and after His own image; in the second place, what “breathed in” means; thirdly, why the breathing is “into the face”; fourthly, why, though he shows his knowledge of the word ‘spirit’ when he says “and the Spirit of God was borne above the water” (Gen. i. 2), he now says “breath” not “spirit.”</s></p></div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section35sent1">In answer to the first query, one thing to be said is that God loves to give, and so bestows good things on all, even those who are not perfect, at the same time encouraging them to a zeal for virtue and a participation in it, by displaying His own overflowing wealth, and how there is abundance even for those who will derive no great benefit from it.</s><s id="Book1section35sent2">This characteristicHe shows very clearly in other instances also.</s><s id="Book1section35sent3">For whenHe rains upon the sea, and causes springs to gush forth in the depths of the desert, and waters the poor and rough and barren soil, pouring on it rivers with their overflowings, what else doesHe prove save the exceeding greatness of His own wealth and goodness?</s><s id="Book1section35sent4">This is the reason for whichHe created no soul barren of virtue, even if the exercise of it be to some impossible.</s></p></div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section36sent1">A second thing to be
said is this.</s><s id="Book1section36sent2">It is His will to make compliance with positive ordinances part of duty.</s><s id="Book1section36sent3">One, then, into whom real life had not been breathed, but who was without experience of virtue, when punished for his transgressions would have said that he is unjustly punished, for that it was through inexperienceof good that he failed in respect of it, and that the blame lay with Him who had failed to breathe into him any conception of it.</s><s id="Book1section36sent4">Nay, he will perhaps say that he does not sin at all, if (as some say) involuntary acts and acts done in ignorance do not count as wrong deeds.</s></p></div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section37sent1">“Breathed into,” we note, is
equivalent to “inspired” or “be-souled” the soulless; for God forbid that we should be infected with such monstrous folly as to think that God employs for inbreathing organs such as mouth or nostrils; for God is not only not in the form of man, but belongs to no class or kind.</s><s id="Book1section37sent2">Yet the expression clearly brings out something that accords with nature.</s></p></div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><s id="Book1section38sent1">For it implies of necessity three things, that which inbreathes, that which receives, that which is inbreathed: that which inbreathes is God, that which receives is the mind, that which is inbreathed is the spirit or breath.</s><s id="Book1section38sent2">What, then, do we infer from these premises?</s><s id="Book1section38sent3">A union of the three comes about, as God projects the power that proceeds from Himself through the mediant breath till it reaches the subject.</s><s id="Book1section38sent4">And for what purpose save that we may obtain a conception of Him?</s></p></div>
